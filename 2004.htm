<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
With the bright comets incoming hopefully, it will be necessary for
<br>all who will image these comets to have a place to show, link, and
<br>discuss there images.  This board will act as an overflow for the
<br>many images which will be created.  It is not to stop an individual
<br>from posting at his regular boards rather a place for the day to day
<br>images a person might have or a newcomer who has no place to post.
<br>Please post a link to your published images, ask questions, and give
<br>advise.  Try to keep the "back patting" and "WOWS" to a minimum as
<br>space is for all but limited.  If you image everyday and want to post
<br>a new link every day then feel free to do so.  All kinds of comet
<br>images are welcome.  Film, ccd through telescopes, cameras or any
<br>other way you can come up with.  All I ask is that the ones who know
<br>answer the questions from those who don't and be kind---please!  This
<br>is for all comets not just the brighter T7 and Q4 and most of all ---
<br>all Comet Imagers.  If you have a problem - Come to me and I will try
<br>to help.  Remember that you have the choice of what to read and what
<br>not to read,  so exercise it.  Enjoy, learn and most of all post your
<br>images for all to see. Mike H.

Subject:  Image Documentation
</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Dear Group,
<br>
<br>I have a suggestion regarding documentation of comet images.  It
<br>stems from a suggestion made by John Bortle of  Comets ML.  I suggest
<br>we provide documentation in our linked images of:
<br>1) Date/time in UTC.  Specify mid-point of a long integration.
<br>2) Image scale: Arc seconds per pixel, horizontal FOV or ruler.
<br>3) Orientation: Arrows or text indicating North and West.
<br>
<br>Other imaging information is of course to be included.  I am always
<br>interested in the scope, mount, camera and processing information in
<br>images I look at.
<br>
<br>Adding these data was a first a burden for me as I had no idea of my
<br>images' orientation.  The orientation of my images varies between
<br>SCT, refractor and piggyback images, and also depends on which side
<br>of the GEM the scope is on.  But now, at last, I think I have it
<br>figured out.   I have a cheat sheet to remind me to rotate images 180
<br>degrees when imaged with the scope on the west side of the mount.
<br>
<br>The image scale is initially a bit difficult as for many it will
<br>involve a bit astrometry to figure out how many pixels there are
<br>between two stars of know angular separation. Fortunately it only has
<br>to be done once for a given camera/scope combination.
<br>
<br>I feel that documentation of the above parameters will lend a note of
<br>professionalism to our images and make them more useful to all comet
<br>followers.  I have some examples of the documentation I use at  my 26
<br>Dec T7 Comet images

A warm regard to everybody.
<br>Am I me from little affiliate and don't I know if you will receive this message, considering that I
<br>succeed to see your messages on the site of the ml, but I don't receive your messages... to thing
<br>can be due?
<br>
<br>A first thing: attachments I can be sent or are they sent you address him where the images are? Or
<br>can the folder of the ml be used?
<br>
<br>I have read how much written by Dennis and I am me of accord with him to 100%, following his
<br>indications we can have a certain homogeneity in the visualization of the images.
<br>
<br>For the discourse arcsec/pixel, without for strength to make some astrometric reduction ,
<br>it is enough to know the dimension of the pixels, or the granularity of the film, and the focal
<br>used, then the following equation is used:
<br>
<br>d" = Dpix x 206265 / focal ( Dpix = dimesion of pixel in mm focal = focal of the optics)
<br>
<br>I for example have a ccd SXV H9 with pixel from 0.00645mm and use an Apo from 600mm
<br>this way I get : d" = 2.2"/pixel if it is used the binning he picks this value and  up it multiplies
<br>him for the binning.

Dennis,

<br>I replied via the web interface, but after quite awhile, have not seen my

<br>
<br>At any rate, since viruses can be propagated via attachments, it is

Dennis,
<br>
<br>Thanks.  I'm using the Borg on a Losmandy G11 mount, guided by an STV
<br>through a 3" Borg.  This is actually my first image from my new (still in
<br>progress) observatory ("Vanishing Point Observatory") on the site of the
<br>Orange County Astronomers Anza, CA site.  I do indeed like my little Borg
<br>100ED scope for its wide field in conjunction with medium format film.
<br>The diagonal across a 6x7 frame is 12.7 degrees, so I ought be ready for a
<br>comet with a long tail!
<br>
<br>As for the 3D version, I guess I'll have to research how to create the
<br>red/blue version.  The reason I don't normally like to view those is that
<br>the color gets affected strangely.  However, it'll be another good
<br>rainy-day project to research.

<br>
<br>Do you make the kind that requires the blue and red glasses or the

<br>The image is already "3D" because the comet moved slightly between two

Hi Dennis I have regularly received the image, but after having read your mails, thing we do? Do we put her on you a site or within to a folder, or do we send her as attached? Sincerely, even if more uncomfortable, is better the first hypothesis, there are too many viruses that turn in the net!

Hi Rolando,
<br>
<br>No more attached images to avoid viruses  good idea!
<br>
<br>Images can be posted to:
<br>1) The poster's own web site, with a link posted to the group
<br>2) The Photos section of the group  about 550 (?) pixels wide maximum
<br>3) The Files section of the group  larger images can go here
<br>
<br>I work only in black and white with CCD  color is too difficult for
<br>me.

Hi..
<br>
<br>Nothing fantastic, just another attempt at this comet, getting some
<br>practice in before the big event.
<br>
<br>This time I managed to squeeze the F/6.3 focal reducer in with 2mm
<br>clearance to the fork base of the telescope. I think my focus is
<br>slightly off though. Also I tried combining several exposures - 10 x
<br>60 second exposures. Mixed results with the stacking, I am yet to
<br>try several programs suggested to me by people replying to my
<br>previous post a couple of weeks back.

Mike,
<br>
<br>You are getting some top images of this comet.  Keep them coming!
<br>
<br>I ran an histogram equalisation on your recent image at it confirms a
<br>couple of things:
<br>
<br>1.  Extreme coma diameter of about 15'.
<br>2.  Obvious disconnection type feature is visible.
<br>3   Total length of tail is 1.5 degrees and is possibly longer - you

Mike:
<br>
<br>    As Terry points out, the extreme diameter of C/2002 T7 outer coma
<br>measured in your recent image is about 15', in good agreement with our
<br>visual observations (13'). This is an obvious increase in size from
<br>previous weeks.
<br>    But the faint tail is for me the most interesting feature in your
<br>image, because is now difficult to observe visually in detail with
<br>binoculars ( I've estimated about 12' of tail in Jan. 9.78 UT, very
<br>short compared to that 1.5 degrees in the image ).
<br>
<br>    Keep on with your good and useful work.

<br>  This color image is a two image mosaic. Only 8 minutes of exposure

<br>  Hi Waldemar,
<br>
<br>  Your home page doesn't seem to have a "New Images" link that  could
<br>  find and the Comets page doesn't have any captions on the images.
<br>  Could you post a link that goes directly to the page with the 180 mm
<br>  image please.  I am interested in seeing it.
<br>

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>I have lots of Canon 35 mm lenses from 24 mm to 300 mm and an adaptor
<br>to my MX716 CCD camera. I even have a 12.5 mm C-mount lens that gives
<br>a 30 degree wide FOV! The CCD sees well into the near IR, so I get a
<br>lot of chromatic aberration  bloated stars  unless I stop down the

Dennis.  The only 35mm or film camera of any kind I have left is a
<br>Minolta MAXXUM 5Xi.  Good camera but has the 100/300 auto zoom/ auto
<br>focus which I don't think would be of much use.  Not sure how the two

<br>I thought I'd try shooting the area where P/2004 A1 is, just incase

<br>I don't have enough stars in my TheSky database to know if I've hit

I just took a quick glance, but it looks like the Sky Map image and

I received some mail wanting to know what the difference in the tail

Hi Everyone,
<br>
<br>Thanks very much for everyone's reply's ... it's great to see I
<br>actually did manage to get it in the FOV !
<br>
<br>Thanks for the star map image Juan, exactly what I needed ... and
<br>thanks to Dave for putting it together with the image.
<br>
<br>I will take a closer look at the original images tonight (having
<br>just woken up and having work to go to all day - don't you hate
<br>that) .. I may be able to do a better job of stacking them to bring

Hey David,

<br>12" LX mounted polar. ST7-ME using CCDSoft v5 and Thesky v4 (only

<br>
<br>I tried using CCDSoft to blink the images I took, but not knowing

<br>the image) being unknown and all, I didn't spot it (there were plenty

<br>With a better idea of the brightness & possition now I'll try

Just make sure you co-add on the comet position (track and Stack)
<br>rather than the star positions - that way you'll be adding the
<br>signal from the comet.  If the comet is around magnitude 17.5 then
<br>you should be able to easily see the comet in a well stretched ccd
<br>image 5 x 60 seconds.  I can get to 18 with my 10" LX200GPS at f/3.4
<br>with 5 x 60 seconds at bin 2x2 and my SX716 (Same chip dimensions
<br>and pixel size as your ST7)

<br>If you have a lot of noise then try a median combine.

Hi,
<br>
<br>I am new to this group; Dennis Persyk informed me about it and I thought I would join. I am rather new to CCD imaging (starting last
<br>May), so most of the time I have been on the starlighxpress site learning and improving. I have a one shot color MX7c from
<br>starlightxpress and for the most am enjoying the fun on making nice looking pictures, which of course I also like to share with anyone
<br>who might be interested. I have always been most interested in comets, because especially if they are fainter, finding them probably
<br>invokes a kind of hunting instinct in me and also because each shot is more or less unique. I do not know if these shots are of any

<br>Hi,
<br>
<br>I am new to this group; Dennis Persyk informed me about it and I thought I
<br>would join. I am rather new to CCD imaging (starting last
<br>May), so most of the time I have been on the starlighxpress site learning and
<br>improving. I have a one shot color MX7c from
<br>starlightxpress and for the most am enjoying the fun on making nice looking
<br>pictures, which of course I also like to share with anyone
<br>who might be interested. I have always been most interested in comets,
<br>because especially if they are fainter, finding them probably
<br>invokes a kind of hunting instinct in me and also because each shot is more
<br>or less unique. I do not know if these shots are of any

<br>Hello Dennis,
<br>just for the record: the CN emissions are mainly concentrated in the violet; the green-blue hue visible in most comets is originated by the diatomic Carbon (C2).

Hi Doug,
<br>
<br>Nice animation.  I've never made one in negative and you have given
<br>me some new ideas.
<br>
<br>The relative motion of T7 is only 1.05 arc second per minute so it is
<br>not moving along very fast.  That is good for general imaging but
<br>means you have to acurie for a long time to get a good animation.

Other information that should have accompanied my first posting about the

<br>
<br>North is up, East is left.
<br>The FOV for those cropped images is 17' x 13' (arcminutes).
<br>The full frame, uncropped, was about 33' x 22'.  The image scale is 2.58

<br>The rate of motion for the comet is about 1.05 arcminutes per hour, so it

Hello Michael.  It is good to have you posting at this board.  As far
<br>as my setup goes, I am, at this time, using a 4" Tak. FSQ106 at F5.3
<br>and a ST2000 CCD.  The brighter comets need the bigger FOV this gives
<br>me.  Normally I would use my 10 F6.3 SCT but I am now looking for the
<br>different tail structure the FSQ gives with a 74x56 arc-min field.
<br>As far as comet 43P/Wolf-Harrington , I don't think that it will
<br>improve much over what it is now although those in the southern skys
<br>could get a little better view over the next few months.  I hope that
<br>the members here will try and image the faint comets as well as the
<br>brighter ones.   Mike H.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I visited Seiichi Yoshida's comet web site and looked up T7's
<br>magnitude chart:
<br>
<br>http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2002T7/2002T7.html
<br>
<br>Seiichi-san shows T7 brightening to magnitude 1.5 or so in the coming
<br>months.  I was all excited.
<br>
<br>Then I checked out the position of T7 for imaging at magnitude 1.5 in
<br>SkyMap Pro and discovered it would be below the horizon.  Now I was
<br>disappointed.
<br>
<br>It really should not come as a surprise as T7 is well past the
<br>meridian now at astronomical twilight.  Here's what is in store for
<br>imaging T7 at the onset of darkness  astronomical twilight  in
<br>Northern Illinois.
<br>
<br>Jan 20  1831 local time m = 7.9 elevation = 56 degrees
<br>Feb 20  1906 local time m = 6.9 elevation = 20 degrees
<br>
<br>So in one month T7 brightens by a whole magnitude but drops down to
<br>just 20 degrees above the horizon.  At 20 degrees I am imaging
<br>through a lot more atmosphere and there is a lot more sky glow from
<br>neighboring cities. Overall I think the brightening will overpower
<br>the other two effects, but I won't have the opportunity to stack an
<br>hour's worth of images any more.  After one hour T7 sinks to 9
<br>degrees off the horizon.
<br>
<br>I like Mike H's call to image other dimmer comets.  We really have no
<br>choice as T7 is sinking fast.

<br>  Hi,
<br>
<br>  I am new to this group; Dennis Persyk informed me about it and I thought I
<br>  would join. I am rather new to CCD imaging (starting last
<br>  May), so most of the time I have been on the starlighxpress site learning and
<br>  improving. I have a one shot color MX7c from
<br>  starlightxpress and for the most am enjoying the fun on making nice looking
<br>  pictures, which of course I also like to share with anyone
<br>  who might be interested. I have always been most interested in comets,
<br>  because especially if they are fainter, finding them probably
<br>  invokes a kind of hunting instinct in me and also because each shot is more
<br>  or less unique. I do not know if these shots are of any
<br>  scientific interest at all, but when I find some more time, I want to learn
<br>  more about how I can progress here too.
<br>
<br>  We have had nothing but bad weather the last weeks here in Austria/Europe
<br>  lately, with one short exception on the 14.1.2003. Here is
<br>  a shot of T7 12 x 5 min with the MX7c at f6.3 (Celestron 8) using
<br>  Starguide2000 on the coma. Each 5 min. image was then corrected
<br>  with dark frames and after synthesis to R,G,B and L, each was stacked on the
<br>  coma. Then processing was done in photoshop.
<br>
<br>  I hope you like it, I uploaded it to the files section.

Dennis.  This image is a total of 3x120 second exposures.  It was
<br>taken with a 4" Refractor @ F5.3 and an ST2000 ccd which gives a FOV
<br>of approx 74x56 arc min.  All images were stacked on the stars not

About faint ones:
<br>
<br>    Although my main interest is visual observation, I'm also a
<br>long-time photographer - imager ( black & white in the sixties, digital
<br>now ). So I agree completely with Mike:
<br>
<br>" I hope that the members here will try and image the faint comets as

<br>
<br>    The good images of bright comets like C/2002 T7 posted here (
<br>previously in Comets-ml ) and in other pages are both beautiful and
<br>useful. In the same "beautiful and useful" way, faint comets are not
<br>only objects for astrometric purposes ( CCD imagers make a great work in
<br>this area ): several of them are also an interesting subject matter for
<br>a photographer's mind.
<br>
<br>    So, try more faint comets like 43P/Wolf-Harrington and the others
<br>that will brighten in the future: C/2003 H1 ( now ~13th magnitude ), ...
<br>
<br>( a good site for that information is Seiichi Yoshida's Home Page:

<br>SPECIALLY USEFUL is the image DATE / TIME in UT, as some members had

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>Thanks for the info.  Probably would be better to append it to the
<br>image or put it in a caption along with the image when you first put
<br>it up.
<br>
<br>That gradient to the east is driving me nuts.  I think it is just
<br>normal sky glow that is interfering with bringing out the very faint
<br>tail structure.  I can see that the tail is probably much longer than
<br>my 30 arc minutes but beyond that it just gets lost in the noise.
<br>
<br>I made up a cardboard cylinder that fits over the refractor.  It has
<br>about 6 layers of waxed paper taped on the end.  I hope to use it to
<br>take flats by pointing the scope at the observatory wall and shining

Subject:  Processing T7s Tail
</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Here is my standard technique for processing a comet images:
<br>
<br>1) Co-register images by aligning on the comet nucleus
<br>2) Combine registered images with Adaptive Add
<br>3) Histogram stretch
<br>4) Form negative
<br>5) Further stretch of negative as required
<br>
<br>Adaptive Add in ImagesPlus performs a linear addition until a pixel
<br>nears saturation, and then logarithmically compresses it. It seems to
<br>work better than Average for me. I sometimes use Median combine to
<br>reduce the effect of star trailing, but this produces a much nosier
<br>image.
<br>
<br>My problem is that the T7's tail signal-to-noise ratio does not seem
<br>to improve with stacking more images, and I don't understand why.
<br>Last night I took a sequence of 9 images of 6 minutes each.  I
<br>achieve about the same image quality in the tail processing one image
<br>as I do with a stack of 9.
<br>
<br>I have considered the possibility that the tail is actually changing
<br>over a time period of minutes, but this seems unlikely to me because
<br>such changes would require large spatial displacements, of the order
<br>of tens of arc seconds.
<br>
<br>Any ideas why stacking doesn't work at present on T7's tail?

Denis,
<br>
<br>Not sure if this helps but I make sure my sub-exposures have no
<br>gradients first and that the background level is the same for all
<br>images. For this I use IRIS.  I always try to get the best possible
<br>flat.

Hi,

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>Big improvement. The tail looks longer now. It is uncanny how we can
<br>go back to an image and improve it after spending hours working on it
<br>initially.  I could never get the hang of color processing when I was
<br>using a borrowed MX7C which is why I got an MX716. You seem to have
<br>figured it out.
<br>
<br>Don't forget to add an image scale so we can see how long the tail is.

<br>Thanks very much Dennis,
<br>
<br>For those of you who want to know the details, I took 4 series of 7
<br>images 60 seconds each, image calibration was done as usual with
<br>flats and darks, then I tracked and stacked the images on the comet's
<br>movement with astrometrica, then I opened the stacks in astroart and
<br>exported them, log scaled, as jpg files. I then used photoshop to
<br>paste them in a big 4 layered file, the alignment of individual
<br>layers was acomplished by setting the opacity of the layer to 50% and
<br>dragging it until visuall match.
<br>
<br>Finally the title was added and 2003 was written instead of 2004,
<br>which is now corrected in my web site.
<br>
<br>If you need any further detail, please don't hesitate contacting me.

Hello,
<br>
<br>I have updated my webpage with a new Q4 image from January 22,
<br>showing some strange tail structure. Apologise for the noisy image
<br>but I had to maximise contrast to show the faint tails.
<br>
<br>I have drawn a PA direction marker on the image and the primary ion
<br>tail is visible along PA 130.  The tail at PA 95 could be dust, but
<br>the tail that starts at PA 70 might be a gas tail feature, judging by
<br>the contorted appearance.
<br>
<br>Visually, the comet is doing well and I estimated magnitude 8.8 in
<br>15x70 Binoculars tonight.

Hi Mike A,
<br>
<br>That is pretty much the technique I use with my SCT where the focal
<br>length varies with the backfocus distance. For my refractor I just
<br>use Ron Wodaski's CDD calculator to determine image scale. It has a
<br>whole bunch of cameras and scopes and you just pick your
<br>combination.  I do have to be careful as I usually resize my images
<br>smaller for use on my website.
<br>
<br>There are many group members who are skilled at astrometry and they
<br>could probably check your calculations for you.
<br>
<br>The scale bar on your image looks good.  On my monitor it is 15 mm
<br>long, so it was easy for me to just hold up a ruler and determine
<br>that you had imaged about a 10 arc minute tail.
<br>
<br>I have been using MaximDL to make my rulers and it is pretty easy.  I
<br>just specify how many pixels per ruler length and whether I want a
<br>black or white ruler.  I have also used Adobe PhotoDeluxe but Maxim
<br>is easier (but more expensive!).
<br>
<br>Clear skies,

Hi Mike H,

<br>Outstanding images, Mike!  The tail detail is exquisite, especially
<br>in the negative.  The bifurcated (two-pronged) structure is now

<br>
<br>I held a ruler up to my monitor and measured 275 mm = 130 arc

Hi Mike C,

<br>Sure are a lot of Mikes in the comet imaging business these days.
<br>
<br>I have been torn between imaging at 3.25 arc seconds per pixel binned
<br>1x1 or 6.5 arc seconds per pixel binned 2x2, with four times the
<br>sensitivity.  In the observatory I like the 1x1 images more with just

<br>
<br>My images also all have a very diffuse, low-contrast tails, but I

<br>
<br>I believe Mike H is using an FSQ106 and SBIG ST2000.  According to
<br>Ron Wodaski's CCD calculator, that is 2.88 arc seconds per pixel,
<br>pretty much what I use.
<br>
<br>Do you have any examples of different resolution images to illustrate

<br>much from night to night that I have not been able to make a good

Dennis:  You must be correct about Mike H's resolution of 2.88.  The level of

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hello,
<br>
<br>> Thank you for the link to the Larson-Sekanina filtered image.  I have
<br>> that filter in AstroArt but I have not yet learned how to apply it.
<br>> I received a Babel Fish translation of an Italian paper from a member
<br>> of Comets-ML but it did not help me much. If you could offer some
<br>> tips in using and interpreting the filter I would appreciate it. I
<br>> have not found any references to its use in English.
<br>>
<br>
<br>Dennis,
<br>
<br>The principe of this filter is to eliminate the coma if it is of same
<br>(radial decreasing) contrast so it enhances the contrast of any structure
<br>present within the coma. For this, each pixel intensity if recomputed by
<br>substracting the mean value obtained with two nearby pixels. These pixels
<br>are taken:
<br>* at the same PA but different distances from the comet-center
<br>---> parameter "dr"
<br>* or at the same distance from the comet-center but at different PA
<br>---> parameter dteta
<br>
<br>Of course, you can combine both parameters.
<br>Mathematically, the image is transformed by a formula (in polar
<br>coordinates):
<br>
<br>I'(r,teta) = I(r,teta) - 0,5 * ( I(r-dr,teta-dteta) + I(r+dr, teta+dteta) )
<br>
<br>Of course, the software has to manage the rectangular (x,y) to polar
<br>coordinates (r,teta).
<br>
<br>Try several values for both parameters :
<br>
<br>dr (in pixels) is useful for showing structures with circular symetry (like
<br>halos for example)
<br>
<br>dteta (in degrees) is very powerful for showing radial structures (like
<br>jets)
<br>
<br>In practice, I find the second parameter is the most useful, I use typical
<br>values of 10 to 20 degrees.
<br>
<br>With smaller values, stuctures often don't emerge from the noisy background,
<br>larger values are useful for enhancing tail detection but you also increase
<br>the risk of merging structures one with each-others.
<br>
<br>Hope this can help !
<br>
<br>I also tried such analysis on C/2002 T7 images taken on january 21. An
<br>interesting structure can be seen towards south-east (PA about 130 deg), but
<br>due to bad weather I haven't enough images to detect any rotation... Weather
<br>in France is unfortunately very bad, and observations very scarce.
<br>
<br>C/2002 T7 is very interesting now but unfortunately it will be no more
<br>visible for me next lunation, too low in the evening sky.
<br>
<br>Best observations to everybody !
<br>

Hello Michael,
<br>
<br>Thanks for the Southern Hemisphere images -- very nice. I also like
<br>your web site  very professional looking.  It is interesting to see
<br>comets that are below the horizon here.
<br>
<br>I also have tried imaging with my C-11 and Meade 3.3 FR and the
<br>result is serious vignetting  well over 50% edge fall off on the
<br>MX716.  The coma is also quite severe. How do you have the FR and

<br>my Jan. 20th visual m1 estimate ( m1 = 13.3 ), and knowing yours ( Jan

<br>Hi Dennis,
<br>
<br>Yes the C11 with Meade 3.3 reducer does produce edge distortion but the FOV
<br>is a reasonable 24'x18' with my MX7c.
<br>I crop the image down to about 15' to remove the distortion.
<br>The benefit of f3.3 is greater detail in a much shorter exposure time, plus
<br>it's easier to focus. I seldom use my f/6.3 FR.
<br>A well collimated telescope is also important. Coma with my setup doesn't
<br>appear to be a major problem.
<br>I'm also currently imaging using an altazimuth mount. Wait till it's on an
<br>equatorial setup!

Hi everyone,

<br>
<br>Some more images of C/2001 Q4. It was tough imaging last night but I
<br>was determined to get something so have add another image to the
<br>gallery. The wind was very strong and gusty.
<br>
<br>Of interest is a comparison image I have also added, comparing my
<br>image from Dec 30th to last night's (26th Jan). I may be incorrect
<br>in my interpretation as the image specifications are not equal but
<br>it looks like the tail has become quite a bit wider, splitting more
<br>distinctly into two tails. Is it normal for a comet to do this as it
<br>approaches the sun? I see posts in the recent thread re C/2001 Q4
<br>about the two tails but that still leaves me wondering about it
<br>widenning out as it appears to have.
<br>
<br>Also are there programs which will show where comets are in relation

<br>would be really helpful in learning the phases of a comet's life

Hi Roger,
<br>
<br>It is fascinating to note the progress of Q4 over a short period of
<br>time.  May I suggest that you orient the images all the same way 
<br>the refractor and SCT images are mirrored and the tail is pointing a
<br>different way. That is disconcerting to me when comparing images.
<br>
<br>For visualizing comet progression along its orbit, I like
<br>http://www.quantumhyperspace.com/Astronomy/OrbitViewer/index.jsp
<br>and
<br>http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/orbits/
<br>
<br>I think they both use the same application.  I have the 3D orbit
<br>representation  pasted into my current New Images page for 43P Wolf-
<br>Harrington if you want to see what it looks like
<br>http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>
<br>Keep us posted on the progress of Q4!

<br>It is a good thing that you have acquired the large chip CCD. The

<br>Congratulations.  The sky cleared in time for me to image T7 tonight
<br>but between the moon and 7 F (-14 C) temperature, I decided to stay

Indeed a wonderful image; I know better than anyone the types of conditions here in Arkansas that Mike must contend with in his capturing of images.
<br>
<br>I do not believe however that this is a disconnect event; the contortions that are evident in Mike's image appear to be more on the order of a relationship between actual physical activity of the comet coincident in time with its interaction with solar plasma, solar wind.

Hi Roger,
<br>
<br>I process like you do  try and get the most out of each image. I
<br>have a real hard time when I make animated GIFs because the
<br>background level changes from one frame to the next even though
<br>conditions are ostensibly the same. Trying to match background
<br>intensities in 100 or so images is boring.
<br>
<br>As for orientation, deciding which end is up and so forth, T7 is
<br>currently oriented with the tail trailing off to the upper left. This
<br>will give you the North up, East left orientation that most imagers
<br>favor.
<br>
<br>To get the angle right, take an exposure while slewing in RA and
<br>adjust the camera until the star trails are parallel to the bottom
<br>edge.
<br>
<br>I believe Dr. Clay prefers the North down "Astronomical" convention,
<br>but I don't see that applied in modern texts or images much any more.
<br>I believe it originated from gazing though scopes with inverted
<br>images. I don't think image orientation matters as long as one
<br>specifies what it is.

<br>Hi Mike:  I've been following your journey with T7 the past few weeks and
<br>am amazed at the variability in the comet structure.  Generally, the
<br>quality of your images has been rather uniform (and outstanding, by the
<br>way), so the variation in comet structure was not likely due to image
<br>processing.  That being said, this current image is qualitatively different
<br>(at on my monitor) from the others -- much higher contrast; saturated
<br>colors, etc.  I wonder if you noticed this as well.

In the past couple of months and especially for the past three weeks
<br>I have taken the same length of exposures and used the same number of
<br>subimages.  This along with processing the comet in the same way each
<br>time gives me a day by day change and I can pretty much tell what
<br>would be comet and noise.  I have never had the opportunity to follow
<br>any comet like this so I am quite surprised at the variance during
<br>only one day.  In the images from 1/28 I took 5x120 second images
<br>which covered a 10 minute period and in a short movie could see the
<br>tail move.  The color image from today not only had the usual 5x120
<br>but the three color filtered images which gave it a deaper look.
<br>After looking for tail structure which was not there for some reason
<br>I added the color info and processed for the color and not
<br>grayscale.  Sometimes when the Moon interfears, the color image is a
<br>better way to produce and show more of the comet.  I am sure that
<br>after the 6th of next month, we can once again regain the faint tail
<br>structure and then some.  One other thing. This comet is now easly
<br>imaged for longer periods as we are moving more inline where a few
<br>weeks ago a 60 sec exposure was all the time allowed without
<br>streaking of the comet.  Mike H.

<br>The comet is once again showing a tail disconnect or some kind of
<br>
<br>disruption.  It appears the second tail which I imaged a couple of
<br>
<br>weeks ago is showing or maybe not this but something else.  It is a
<br>
<br>mess at this time.  I am posting two images.  The first is a 74x56
<br>
<br>arc-min image of 5x120 sec frames.
<br>
<br>  http://www.fototime.com/DA09FD56B9AEE48/orig.jpg
<br>
<br>The second is a mosaic negative of 4 frames croped down to approx.
<br>
<br>130 arc min.  each of the 4 frames is composed of 5x120 sec sub
<br>
<br>frames combined in Photoshop7.   There is a small version
<br>
<br>http://www.fototime.com/C284E1AFF913C13/standard.jpg
<br>
<br>Or the full size which is almost 1 mb but nice to look at for
<br>
<br>detail.  All images taken with the 4" and ST2k CCD

Ok, the Moon is a problem right now and the air was freezing on the

Hi Johannes,
<br>
<br>You have captured about 21 arc minutes of tail even with the bright
<br>moon. That is considerably better than I was able to get on Jan 30th
<br>with 14 x 2 minutes at f/5.4 with my 4-inch refractor. See
<br>http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>
<br>I wonder how much tail length we are losing due to moon
<br>interference?
<br>
<br>The comet is sinking fast in the west for me so next new moon may be
<br>my last chance for good images of  T7.  We'd better get it while the
<br>getting is good.

Hello to all....
<br>I thought that you would all be interested in learning a bit more about Mike
<br>Holloway, who has provided us with some very fine images of comets Encke and
<br>Linear T7 as late; Mike lives in my neck of the woods and I was pleased when
<br>informed that this group had feature both him and his fine observatory.

<br>You can find this article describing both at:

<br>I think you have captured the ion tail (top) and the shorter but

<br>
<br>Hello Dennis,
<br>as far as I know, there isn't yet a real standardization about CCD
<br>photometry of cometary comae. Some people is used to integrate within
<br>a window as large as the coma itsef, while others, like the Italian
<br>Comet Section and the CARA project, prefers to scale the window
<br>aperture to a fixed size (e.g. 100,000 Km) at the comet distance.
<br>This step has the advantage to fix at least one variable.
<br>
<br>If you decide to follow these last suggestion the equivalent circular
<br>aperture for your window should be calculated according the formula :
<br>
<br>Aperture (arcsec)= 138/Delta
<br>where Delta= Eatch-comet distance in UA
<br>
<br>If you are using a square aperture (like those in Astroart)
<br>then the formula becames:
<br>
<br>Aperture (arcsec) = 122.3/Delta
<br>
<br>Ciao,
<br>Giovanni

Very nice image Mike.  I hope to get out this weekend and try this comet with

Thanks.  The gradient in this case is caused by bad flatts.  I am
<br>pretty sure the position of the camera moved so today I will create

I imaged T7 last night. The two-pronged tail is prominent. There are
<br>two magnitude 15 galaxies in the same FOV.
<br>
<br>I imaged the comet down to 17.4 degrees above the horizon. The comet
<br>is much brighter which seems to aid imaging at low elevations. At
<br>these low elevations I am troubled more by sky glow than by
<br>atmospheric extinction.  This is especially true now that the ground
<br>is white with snow.
<br>
<br>The two-pronged tail is still evident but imaging is becoming
<br>increasingly difficult due to twilight and low elevations.  I hope I
<br>can get it as a morning comet but it does not look promising.

Hi,
<br>
<br>Last night I finally got a short time of imaging in weeks before the
<br>next bad weather front rolled in. Linear was low in the sky and
<br>already enveloped in a thin whispy cloud layer. Wind gusts were
<br>another problem but I tried anyway. I binned 2x2 this time and
<br>averaged 5 x 5 min. with my MX7c at f6.3 on a C8. The tail I could
<br>get much of  too noisy  but still, the size of this comet and the
<br>brightness/color were impressive for me.
<br>
<br>Hope you like it anyway,

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>Thanks for checking out my faint (for me, anyway) comet.
<br>
<br>To be honest, I was not sure I had imaged it until I compared my 15
<br>image stack (aligned on stars) image with Guide 8 and noted the
<br>smudge was right where it should be.
<br>
<br>The trouble with an animation is that I can't see the comet in a

<br>I need a faster scope!

<br>Hi Mike,
<br>I wonder if you do your imaging remotely using VNC?  I had similar
<br>banding problem and found the cause to be moving the mouse (in order to
<br>refresh the VNC window) during digitization/download. Once I figured it
<br>out it was easy to see that they were correlated. I moved the mouse at
<br>the start and end of the download which gave me bands at the top and
<br>bottom of the image. Left it alone; no bands. Moved it for a longer
<br>period in the middle of the download, and got a single wide band in the
<br>center of the image!
<br>Anyway, there are lots of causes of interference so this may not be the
<br>cause in your situation.  I hope it helps.

Hi Vello,

<br>maybe your right because I do move the mouse a lot during imaging and

<br>
<br>Up until now, I have been imaging relatively bright comets, magnitude
<br>
<br>9 and brighter.  This comet at magnitude 16.3 was a real challenge!
<br>
<br>Whereas I usually see the comet in a 5 second centering image, this
<br>
<br>comet remained invisible until I stacked 11 5-minute images.  I had
<br>
<br>to trust my digital setting circles that the comet was somewhere in
<br>
<br>the FOV.
<br>
<br>Image 11 x 5 minutes unguided with 4-inch refractor at f/5.4; MX716
<br>
<br>camera.
<br>
<br>Note how bright magnitude 13.1 nebula IC 381 is in comparison to the
<br>
<br>comet.
<br>
<br>The relative motion was 0.33 arc seconds per minute.  Over the 55
<br>
<br>minute period this caused an 18 arc second blurring of the comet,
<br>
<br>equivalent to 6 pixels.  I could not see the comet in the individual
<br>
<br>frames, so I could not co-register on it.  I guess I am going to have
<br>
<br>to learn how to use Astrometica! It displaces each frame according to
<br>
<br>the relative motion of the comet as determined by ephemeredes.

Wow Mike, you are a dedicated T7 follower!  Imaging it with a bright

Hi Juan,
<br>
<br>no, only this image. It is very slightly seen on every raw I stacked only
<br>from this image. Bringing out the tail of the comet in processing also
<br>enhances the artifact. Maybe you could be right, since I have seen this

Dennis.  I truthfully don't know how low it was but guessing I would
<br>say 12 or 13 degrees above the horizion.  I actually still have an
<br>hour of imaging time left with clear skys.  I don't think that the 10

More images from 0200UT with clear skys.  Comet is a very bright
<br>central point.  I guess the only reason I still image it is to make
<br>sure it is still there.  Perhaps if the weather holds I can get a day
<br>or two without the Moon but even then this comet is a different

<br>
<br>I imaged C/2003 H1 LINEAR with considerable difficulty last night.
<br>The comet was low in the sky towards Chicago at an elevation of only
<br>20 degrees.  The sky glow was bright and my visual limiting
<br>magnitude in that sector was about 1.0  .  I could barely see
<br>magnitude 8 stars in the 11 inch SCT.
<br>
<br>Imaging was a balance between short exposures to minimize comet head
<br>trailing and longer images to improve the signal to noise in the
<br>tail structure. After experimenting with exposures between 30 and
<br>480 seconds, I opted for 360 seconds.  I accumulated 7 frames but
<br>after processing them the next morning I wished I had taken more to
<br>get better definition of the tail.
<br>
<br>I also have a very short video showing the comet's track for 28
<br>minutes across Hydra.

<br>Very nice closeup. What magnification was this? Also what is the comet's

Dr Eric,
<br>
<br>I am glad you like the image.  Magnification doesn't have any meaning
<br>when talking about photographic images, the closest equivalent term
<br>would be image resoluion which is about 3.5 arc-sec per pixel in the
<br>original image - so the planet Jupiter would appear about 15 pixels
<br>wide at this scale.  Hope that helps..
<br>
<br>Currently, the comet is about magnitude 6.5 and easily visible in

<br>liked to have seen a more developed tail but it should improve
<br>significantly by May.

Terry,
<br>
<br>You continue to get good images of this comet. I have been having
<br>extreme troubles imaging Q4 because all night it pops in and out of
<br>behind trees, so I ended up with a patchy view and blurred tree's at
<br>best :-)
<br>
<br>It's nice to see the long tail - the first amateur image I've seen
<br>with what looks like the full tail length. The only other image I had
<br>seen with it was in space.com's Image Of The Day site from a pro obs
<br>in Chile.

Hi Juan,
<br>
<br>I like the H1 imagery very much!  You have captured a much longer
<br>tail than I did a couple of weeks ago.
<br>
<br>The isophotes superimposed over the negative image is an excellent
<br>way of highlighting the tail structure.  I hope you don't mind if I
<br>use your technique on my next comet image. You were fortunate to
<br>capture the comet when its tail was not washed out by bright stars.
<br>
<br>On the middle isophote image you have a axis drawn through the
<br>nucleus.  I assume this is a line through the sun.  The axis of the
<br>tail makes about a 30 degree angle with the line solar axis. I think
<br>I know how to draw such a line now but I've not tried yet in an
<br>image.
<br>
<br>If the tail were an ion tail, we would expect it to be along the
<br>solar axis, whereas a dust tail curves as it follows along the
<br>curving orbit of the comet  is this correct?
<br>
<br>Perhaps you could put together a little tutorial on these aspects
<br>for the group.  I'm sure there would be considerable interest.
<br>
<br>Thanks for sharing the images with us.  They are truly inspiring.

<br>fore-shortened as we look along the orbit.. Q1's inclination is 99
<br>degrees, so it's pretty much heading up straight up toward the ecliptic
<br>plane from below.

Hi Vello/list,
<br>
<br>Great photo Vello!
<br>
<br>For comparsion I did a 9 minute exposure with Canon 300D and 100mm

<br>just a hint of nearly ~2 degrees of tail + a dust tail <1 degree.

<br>Hi Terry,
<br>You've really captured the dust tail well!  Apart from the triangular
<br>coma, it's hardly visible on my image.
<br>
<br>BTW, I looked at your 300D page. Impressive LMC shot!  It should perform
<br>nicely when the comet gets brighter. I tested a Canon Powershot S30
<br>recently. The lens is tiny, max ASA rating is 800 and exposures are
<br>limited to 15sec, so I'm going to need a lot of stacked images. I was
<br>hoping for a better result but it doesn't look like the right tool for
<br>the job. Here's hoping for a really bright comet to compensate for the
<br>camera's inadequacies ;-)
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Vello

<br>I put the 300D on my Tak Epsilon E160 tonight, before the rain came

Hi Terry,
<br>
<br>Excellent image!  I also clicked on the "click here" on your web
<br>site and was treated to a comprehensive image chronology of the
<br>comet  very instructive.
<br>
<br>I just got a Takahashi  Epsilon 160 astrograph myself and have lots
<br>of questions:
<br>1) How do you mount the 300D?
<br>2) How do you judge best focus  I assume you are rotating the rack
<br>and pinion knob by hand. Do you have a video output or are you using
<br>the built-in LCD screen?
<br>
<br>My mentor says I should really use film with the E160 to take
<br>advantage of its large flat field.  I sold my darkroom equipment
<br>about 20 years ago and I consider film a large step backwards in
<br>time.  Hence my interest in the 300D.
<br>
<br>Keep the images coming, Terry.  Pretty soon the comet will be
<br>visible in my neck of the woods.
<br>
<br>Clear skies,
<br>

Dennis,
<br>
<br>Congratulations..the Epsilon 160 is fine astrograph!
<br>
<br>As for mounting the camera you should have got a T ring attachment
<br>with the scope (I think it is called a Takahashi Wide T-Adapter or
<br>similiar). This has a screw-thread on one side that attaches to the
<br>focuser and on the other side a tapered flange (The 'T'). To complete
<br>the equation you then need to get a Canon EOS T-Adapter (I think
<br>Parks/Orion sell them - I got mine off astromart) which attaches the
<br>T to the EOS mount.
<br>
<br>I am using the preview screen to focus using a star (using the rack-
<br>and-pinion) - problem is there is not enough zoom magnification on
<br>the preview.  Maybe DSLRfocus is the next item to get and then a
<br>precision focuser like Mike pointed out.
<br>
<br>I made a custom back for my E160 a while back, and it covers an image
<br>circle of 54mm - about 6 degrees.  Although sharp to the edges, its
<br>major drawback is vignetting.  Even with 35mm film the edges are
<br>noticeably vignetted.  I think the 300D/Rebel is a good match as the
<br>field is still well illuminated and - at least for comets - you
<br>should gain some sensitivity to make up for the loss of FOV. Of
<br>course ease of use is in favour of the DSLR....
<br>
<br>Terry

O-the weather.  While waiting on a break from the many inches or rain
<br>that we are receiving I thought I would look just a little ahead.  K4
<br>visible in the morning sky will start to increase in brightness and
<br>should be one to keep on the chip.  According to Guide8 this comet
<br>will increase to magnitude 9.5 by the first week in May and the
<br>position should give for some really good wide field views especially
<br>for the DSLR users.  April 16th the comet will move within 30 arc-min
<br>of NGC 6885.  It will then cross the Milkyway which should be prime
<br>for imaging.  5 May it is 5 arc-min from Diffused Neb. LBN158.  For
<br>the next few days it will travel N-N/W and on 8 May be next to the
<br>Nebula LBN158.  At this time this comet will be around 9.4 according
<br>to prediction.  Moving ahead to July 28 2004 the comet will be in the
<br>West sitting on top (?) of NGC 5466 mag.9.  At this time the comet
<br>shows to be at magnitude 6.5.  Always helps to plan just a little
<br>ahead for me so I can start gathering my info.  Mike H.

<br>Thanks Eric for your comments. When you click on the thumbnails, the

<br>in UT and relevant technical information.
<br>All the pictures were adquired by me from La Cañada Observatory at

<br>Most of them are 60 sec. frames stacked on the comet's movement using

Terry,
<br>You know we love the old Pentax 35mm cameras being piggybacked - and it is
<br>very encouraging to hear the old K1000 may be coming out from mothballs! :-)
<br>
<br> Personally i dont care overly about red sensitivity in imaging - i mean i
<br>cant physically see much red in the night sky (apart from red stars of
<br>course and the odd aurora, sunsets ect.) so if one was trying to closely as
<br>possible reproduce how the night sky appears to the human eye, than the red
<br>nebula's are not truly representative of that view, i think anyway. It is
<br>good to see stuff brought out in widefield/all images that you wouldnt see
<br>naked eye, but there are plenty of people already doing that maybe.
<br> But if there were suddenly a bright red comet, of course i would change my
<br>tune!

<br>>From May 7 - 8, 2004, observations of comet C/2001 Q4 are planned

<br>According to the current planning the observations will start on May 7,

<br>Hi all,
<br>
<br>well I finally returned from Japan on Wednesday - with a new Canon EOS 10D.
<br>So have been trying it out over the last two nights. The results (and an image
<br>of Comet 2001 Q4) can be seen at...

G'day All,
<br>
<br>After starting imaging Q4 back in December 03 and then it disappearing
<br>behind tree's for the last few months it has finally re-appeared for me to
<br>snap a few short images between the branches. It was only visible for 10
<br>minutes total so this 5 minute exposure is the best I have unfortunately.
<br>
<br>Still, it's not bad. Wider FOV and longer exposure would be nice.
<br>
<br>The first image at:
<br>http://members.iinet.net.au/~rog1/astro/gallery/photo/galleryComets/
<br>
<br>It looks very similar to John's image which is re-assuring :-) Although I
<br>didn't get that thin tail.

<br>Roger.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>I'm not certain, but it seems from images I have taken over the last few nights that C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)s thin gas tail has disappeared (or at least reduced)... See the three comparative images at...

<br>http://www.possumobservatory.co.nz/20-2Comets-C-2001Q4(NEAT)-tail_change.htm
<br>
<br>On the 10th and 13th of April the thin spike of a tail is seen, but tonight (14th) it is not evident. Can any other cometographers verify this (Terry et al?)???

John,
<br>Excellent images! The color and star sharpness are great!
<br>I tried to calculate your field of view for a 24mm diagonal chip (app
<br>D10 size) and I came up with approximately 1X1.5 degrees. I was using
<br>8" f/4 (FL =800mm). You indicated that the tail was a little over 1
<br>degree. Is that part of the tail not visible in the photo or did I
<br>calculate something wrong, because the tail would represent nearly
<br>the width of the image at the scale I calculated ?
<br>
<br>I want to try to image C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) when it arrives here
<br>(Southern California) next month. I am trying to determine the best
<br>FOV for the images. I would like to take one to show some surrounding
<br>sky for perspective and one of just the comet for detail. I will be
<br>using one or all of these combinations CCD (ST10XME or STV), Film
<br>(35mmm Nikon), DSLR (Nikon D1X). Do you have any recommendations?
<br>Thanks, Rick

Hi Rick,
<br>
<br>Camera lenses generally work best at two stops or more down from
<br>full open.  The comet will be big and bright so lens choice will
<br>depend on tail length and how you want to frame the comet.  The zoom
<br>will work fine.  The IR cut filter is not required.
<br>
<br>By the way, is this film, CCD, or digital camera?

Dennis,
<br>Thanks for the input. I am planning on taking all 3 capabilities.
<br>I will take a film camera for piggy back because I know that I can
<br>capture something this way (this is my backup).
<br>I will take a DSLR for similar reason as above and I can get
<br>immediate feedback (it is easy to swap out with film SLR, but may

<br>I will be wanting to try CCD, but I am new and don't want to miss the
<br>comet due to rookie mistake.
<br>I will be traveling to dark sky location, so I will only get 1 or 2
<br>trys.
<br>I don't think I can image form back yard as I am 15 miles due south
<br>of Los Angeles and if we don't have fog (only about 10% of the time),
<br>we have about Mag 3.3 skies.

John,
<br>
<br>I have wide angle images of Comet Q4 on the evenings of April 13 and
<br>14 for you to have a look at on my webpage.  The tail was definitely
<br>quite a bit fainter (especially near the coma) on the 14th, but
<br>notice the very subtle wavy structure all the way to the edge of the
<br>frame.  It looks like a disconnection type event to me.
<br>
<br>There is only so much the Canon can do in a 17minute exposure so I am

<br>combo.

<br>Hi Rick,
<br>I use a Nikon ED 80-200mm zoom (fixed f/2.8) for my images. It's a
<br>superb lens in every way. I think your EDIF is the newer model. Anyway,
<br>I find that it produces great images even at f/2.8 and doesn't need an

<br>John & Terry,
<br>Unfortunately I didn't get any images last night, but I do have some
<br>from the 12th and 13th. There was a noticeable change between those
<br>nights. The thin ion tail is less well defined on the 13th. Curiously,
<br>while I was selecting images to stack, I saw quite a bit of variation
<br>from image to image, but I put it down to noise. Since I have many 30sec
<br>images from the 13th spread over about 1.5 hours, I might try to combine
<br>them into 10min stacks to see if I can detect any changes...

Hi Rick,
<br>
<br>I guesstimated Q4's tail length as 1.1* by comparing the image to GUIDE 8. The FOV is about 1.5* x 1*. In regards to what equipment to use, the advice from Terry and Vello (great images guys!) sounds good. I think that travelling to a dark sky is a must if you want to capture the faint, extended tail (wider-angle lens needed - e.g. 10* - 30*+(?). If you just want the coma/nucleus, stay at home and zoom in with a longer focal length - it is nice and bright. Getting brighter too...
<br>
<br>Hi Terry,
<br>
<br>thanks for the shots - which are great! Yes, it seems from yours also that the thin gas spike tail broadens out and becomes wavey and more subtle. Cheers. The next two months should be interesting comet-wise.
<br>
<br>Cheers

Hi Rick,
<br>
<br>It sounds like you have some nice gear for comet imaging.  I've been
<br>studying a lot of comet images from the spaceweather.com archives,
<br>the APML archives and other sites.  My favorite photos always
<br>involve capturing the entire comet from coma to tail, good detail
<br>and a dark background with many stars.  These type of shots
<br>generally all require film with a Schmidt Camera or a fast 200-300mm
<br>telephoto.  So next month, weather providing, I plan to piggyback my
<br>Nikon F/Nikkor 300mm f/2.8 to my C11.  I'm thinking of using either
<br>Kodak E200 or Elite II film, perhaps bracketing 5-15 minute
<br>exposures and may also try stepping down on a few shots...  I also
<br>may take some shots with my Nikkor 200mm f/4, 135mm f/3.5 and 50mm
<br>f/1.4.  But from my Ikeya Zhang experience, it seemed that even the
<br>200mm f/4 wasn't fast enough to capture the detail I would have
<br>liked.  That was my rationale, good or bad, for spending some dough
<br>on the monster 300mm f/2.8 (used of course!).  And I've been
<br>following Q4 ever since Ikeya Zhang--even if it mirrors that comet
<br>in brightness and size--I'd be plenty happy.  Either way I'm looking
<br>forward to early May for sure.
<br>
<br>Some of my favorite comet shots include those of the members here as
<br>well as those by Michael Jager and Gerald Rhemann
<br>(http://www.astrostudio.at/).
<br>
<br>Clear skies to you,

On my webpage you will see 2 images side by side, on the right hand

Hi Terry,

<br>The high-end camera lenses do not seem to suffer as much when used

If you have not taken a look at the newly discovered
<br>comet Bradfield passing by the sun in the SOHO images,
<br>you are indeed missing a rare site.
<br>
<br>http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime/c3/512/latest.gif
<br>
<br>The comet tail is warped around the sun and the
<br>streamers in the tail are very detailed in the SOHO
<br>LASCO C3 instrument.
<br>
<br>I am looking at the 04/18/2004 1854 image.
<br>http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime/javagif/gifs_tiny/20040418_1854_c3.gif
<br>
<br>Fantastic!!! It is out of this world.
<br>
<br>If you open this page:
<br>
<br>http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime/realtime-c3.html
<br>
<br>you can see all the recent images for a quick eyeball
<br>comparison.
<br>
<br>The spikes in the head are due to the infamous ccd
<br>camera blooming phenomenon and because of this, it is
<br>estimated that the comet is estimated to be at
<br>magnitude -2. That is based upon several other bright
<br>comets tat passed thoug perihelion while in view on
<br>SOHO. Mercury does this when it passes across the
<br>field of view.
<br>
<br>Venus is currently at mag -3
<br>Jupiter is currently at mag -2.3
<br>Saturn is currently at mag +0.8
<br>
<br>Compare that.
<br>
<br>Comet C/2004 F4 (Bradfield) is currently about halfway
<br>between the moon and sun, and about 4 degrees from the sun.

<br>BIG COMET VAPORIZES IN A DISTANT STAR

<br>Apr 19, 2004 - Astronomers from Penn State University have spotted a large

<br>LkHalpha 234, which is 6 times the mass of the Sun, but only 100,000 years

This subject is really off-topic for this group.....but:
<br>I have some very serious reservations about accepting such an idea based on "....the light from the star change[ing] as if it were obscured by cometary material...."
<br>
<br>The vaporization of a 100km [gasp!] comet at a distance of 3,200 light years would hardly be enough to obscure starlight to the point that it could be measured here on earth.  I suppose that if our present Comet Bradfield likewise "vaporizes" next week, there will be zealous observers monitoring the obscuration of our own sun as seen from LkHalpha234.
<br>
<br>Just the words "....large comet crashing...." into a star should send red flags out to anyone who reads this material.  I for one would be most interested in being witness to our sun being "crashed" by a comet or any other body.

<br>Beautiful images Terry. I don't know if this is a processing artifact
<br>but T7 looks quite blue compared to Q4, which is more greenish.
<br>Coincidentally perhaps, T7 looks strikingly blue to me through 20x80s.
<br>OTOH, Q4 doesn't seem to be bright enough for me to discern any colour.
<br>Perhaps it's just that it is less condensed and has has a larger coma,
<br>but your camera seems to have picked the difference too...

Hi guys,
<br>
<br>Somewhat better conditions this morning, still a fair amount of water
<br>vapour in the air but I had no trouble seeing the comet naked eye,
<br>even the tail was just visible to the naked eye.  Anyway I have
<br>uploaded an image to my webpage using the Canon 300D + 100mm lens.
<br>Next time I will compose the comet better on the frame, as the actual
<br>extent of the tail was more than I had expected (Id say there is
<br>closer to 8-10 degrees of tail).
<br>
<br>Interesting note every so often I find an image gets corrupted on the
<br>CF card, this happened this morning when I lost one of my
<br>subexposures.
<br>
<br>Vello - Colour balance is something I am still coming to grips with.
<br>I have started to calibrate on stars of spectral type G2 or near, the
<br>image yesterday was perhaps slightly too blue (but this mornings T7
<br>effort should be close).  Q4 has definitely got more green (stronger
<br>C2 emmission?).

<br>Congrats. The images are magnificent. I am looking forward to trying to see

<br> Q4 seems to have a greenish tinge and a very fluffy looking tail . T7 have a

Yes - its a real pain.  My 14" dewed up by 8pm :-(  35% Humidity at

Hi David,

<br>The larger SCTs tend to dew up worse than the smaller ones.  There

<br>A long (2 or 3 x diameter) dew shield will help immensely by

Hi,
<br>Dr. Eric, I think you might want to try some test images in the
<br>general part of the sky and time when you will image the comets. My
<br>guess is that film will beat the P&S digitals and probably most
<br>digital SLRs. CCD will probably beat both. My reasoning is that film
<br>and CCD allow longer exposures, in addition, CCD has higher
<br>sensitivity. I believe that these will capture the faint tail better.
<br>People have been having a lot of success with Canon DSLRs at 5 to 10
<br>min exposures. I am going to be trying the same thing if I can get my
<br>mount tracking in time. I will run test shots first.
<br>Hope this helps.

DJ,
<br>Schmidt camera is probably very good for this. Why do you think film
<br>would be better? I think film is higher resolution and has better
<br>color response, but I think that sensitivity and reciprocity would
<br>out weigh the resolution and color. I think it really comes down to
<br>how long do you need to capture the wispy tail detail. If that time
<br>is 1 minute, then I agreee that film would win hands down, but as
<br>exposure goes past 1 min on most films, the reciprocity starts
<br>cutting into effective response. I am talking about standard films
<br>such as E-200. I belive that hypered films give fantastic response to
<br>color for these images, based on images that I have seen on HaleBopp.
<br>If you have any more data, please share with us. Maybe someone will
<br>do an apples to apples comparison on these 2 comets.
<br>Happy comet hunting,

Hi all
<br>Wellll!!! what a revolution! - dont think there will be a comet imager left
<br>who doesnt own a nice DSLR/CCD before very long! :-) Congrats to the
<br>stunning work that all you guys are doing - god help the unsuspecting comets
<br>that come this way from now on - the days of scant (but excellent) coverage
<br>are long gone. ( i mean, imaging through clouds and fog for goodness sake!!
<br>love it!)
<br>
<br>Please find our humble offerings on emulsion from morning of 20th april (19
<br>UT) at  <http://www.southern-x.org/gallery-q4t7a.html>
<br>
<br>Also we had much foggy nebulosity to photograph through for T7 on the 20th.
<br>
<br>Notes on session from dark site - first session after weeks of mostly clouds
<br>-
<br> we were easily able to see, conservatively, .5 deg of bright anti-tail in
<br>8x56 binos (used field of view of binos 6.25* ) on T7 with an easy main tail
<br>of 4 deg. and about a degree of main tail naked eye. We kind of lost it when
<br>we saw T7 for first time, and didnt take many images - due to trying to
<br>drink in the views through varies means - and swinging from one comet to
<br>another :-)) Q4 had about a faint 5* tail in binos. The binocular views
<br>seemed better than our images- strange?
<br>second morning patchy clouds came in at very last minute >:( - but Q4 was
<br>noticebly brighter and had slightly larger coma to naked eye - but couldnt
<br>see much antitail on T7 in binos second morning (wed), but T7 looked
<br>brighter with longer main tail of 6* (B) and still ~1* naked eye tail.
<br>
<br>Amazing too how T7 leaps out of the page, figuratively speaking, more and
<br>more (when viewing it) as it climbs every half a degree of elevation - could
<br>be a very serious comet eh
<br>
<br>heres hoping for lots of dust production and the comets getting big enough
<br>to make for some interesting colour photographs.
<br>
<br>Cheers
<br>Kearn

I too confirm your observation of C/2003 T3 (Tabur). Today C/2004 F4 was
<br>impressive in 7x50 binoculars. Before the start
<br>of astronomical twilight, with the comet's head under the horizon, the
<br>curved 11.5-deg long dust tail protuded up above the Cantabrian
<br>Mountains ridge. As a plus, the dimmer and close C/2003 T3 (Tabur ) was
<br>visually observed through that tail. A sight to remember ...
<br>
<br>C/2004 F4 (Bradfield):
<br>2004 Apr. 25.15 UT: m1=3.7, Dia.=2', DC=8,  Tail: 11.5 deg. in PA 300
<br>deg,7x50B [ Naked eye: m1=4.0, Tail: 8.5 deg.. Mountain location, very
<br>clear sky. Magnitude estimate corrected for atmospheric extinction with
<br>ICQ winter table. Low
<br>altitude. Beginning of astronomical twilight. ]
<br>
<br>C/2002 T7 (LINEAR):
<br>2004 Apr. 25.17 UT: m1=4.4, Dia.=3', DC=7, Tail: 0.2 deg. in PA 255 deg
<br>11x80B. [ Magnitude estimate corrected
<br>for atmospheric extinction. Low altitude. Beginning of nautical twilight
<br>].

<br>What a nice image and detective work. The Orange - brown tinge to f4 tail is
<br>a nice contrast to the white head of the comet f4.

Hi,
<br>Here is a new image of T7 from this morning. The morphology continues to

Hi all,
<br>
<br>managed to drag myself out of bed at 4.30am this morning to photograph Comet 2002 T7 (LINEAR) in the eastern morning sky. I piggybacked the Canon EOS 10D with a 150mm f4.5 lens on it. The two linked photos show the result (note the <small> 'antitail' at 5 oclock). I have overenhanced the second image to bring out the tail. I was battling high cloud and the zodiacal light - and a low (13*) elevation...
<br>
<br>http://www.possumobservatory.co.nz/latest_images-04-04-26.htm
<br>
<br>My observation of it is:
<br>
<br>2002 T7 (LINEAR) 2004 April 26.71 UT: m1 = ~4.3, Dia.= ~6'.0,      DC = 7,      Tail = 4* PA 252* 10x50B...John Drummond, (Gisborne, New Zealand) [T7 low in pre-dawn eastern sky. Bright with a nice longish tail - at least 4* long. Compact head - easily seen with naked eye. Contended with zodiacal light and some high cloud. Comet's alt is 13* in the ENE.].

John,

<br>Great images!  My only comment is that your stated FOV seems too
<br>large (for 150mm FL I get 9 x 6 degrees approx).
<br>
<br>The 30 second exposure on M20 is pretty amazing too...

I agree Vello! they indeed have a very beautiful stunning classic comet to
<br>enjoy, any southerners jumped on a plane yet?
<br> i find it bizarre that, in that last few years, everytime we get a nice
<br>comet, suddenly some nice thoughtful person finds a nice comet for the
<br>northerners to enjoy! i am referring of course to when C/2000 WM1 had its
<br>break up and jumped to mag. 2.5 at the end of jan 2002, all of a sudden
<br>Ikeya Zhang appeared out of nowhere! (mind you, it had skirted just outside
<br>of some of our widefield images from dec2001, jan 2002 at up to mag 9
<br>prediscovery ;-) )
<br>
<br>I was wondering are these the first such occasions that this has happened,
<br>or has it happened before? seems the odds are very stacked against such
<br>co-incidences i would think?. or are they coming in batches now?
<br>
<br>I also see reports that some people are seeing Bradfield and T7 naked eye at
<br>same time from some northern latitudes. Can anyone tell me when this has
<br>happened before - where both hemispheres have two naked eye comets available
<br>to them at the same time?

Here is a 12 panel mosaic of Q4 passing the LMC on April 25. It's a bit
<br>dated now because of the amount of processing effort I had to put in.
<br>I'm still not completely happy with it, but if your turn the contrast
<br>down a bit it looks half decent.
<br>
<br>Who said pretty pictures were easy? Each panel of the mosaic is a stack
<br>of 10x30sec images. Each stacked image was then gradient corrected by
<br>overlaying a 64x64 pixel grid and calculating the background intensity
<br>in each cell of the grid. With that value, each cell was corrected to
<br>remove the gradient. Then an astrometric solutuion was calculated for
<br>each panel and they were aligned /stiched into a 6000 x 4000 pixel
<br>mosaic. But (and there' always a but), the panels containing the LMC had
<br>no "empty sky" to calculate/interpolate a background value, so the
<br>gradient could not be removed without removing most of the LMC too. So I
<br>resorted to using other images taken at similar alt/az to calc the
<br>gradient and then corrected the LMC panels with the same grid. This left
<br>some unsightly seams which had to be balanced manually. By this stage I
<br>was just about ready to admit defeat, but I managed to salvage something...
<br>
<br>You might be asking why I didn't use a shorter focal length lens in the
<br>first place? Well I have overhead powerlines very close to my
<br>observatory and they would have interfered. Instead I had to wait until
<br>each field cleared the lowest power line and then took the images.

Hi All
<br>I have uploaded a 300K file to the file section of this site.
<br>
<br> We have detected what looks like a large split tail (same as Vello Tabur
<br>Picture from same morning) and what seems like quite considerable tails on
<br>T7 for in our photos from morning of april 26th 2004 (26.74 UT). i thought
<br>that they were a strange effect from poor photo lab processing , maybe
<br>chemicals to old or used to much, with a roller wheel track through them.
<br>But the q4 shots are from the same roll and they seem normal enough.
<br>
<br> But when we looked closer we are not completely sure as what to make of it.
<br>i havent got time to get them reprocessed at the moment, so i was hoping
<br>some brave soul would have a crack at determining whats tail and whats not.
<br>That would be much appreciated if possible.  if the larger tail is real it
<br>goes out of the photo in that case. please contact me off list if you can
<br>help. belatrix@ozemail.com.au
<br>
<br>Image is 10 minute exposure on 800 speed film 105mm lens  35mmm camera -
<br>taken through vary thicknesses of thin cloud. cloud obscures fair bit of
<br>image, including tails at end. Comet was at around 15.5 * altitude.

<br>David and all
<br>
<br>I did not have any luck 4/26 but I did this morning 4/27. I camped out on a
<br>ridge West of I-69 on 167 street ( off of 151 st East of Olathe, KS near Kansas
<br>City, USA for those not in KC)
<br>
<br>At 4:45 to a little after 5, I could see the comet very low on the horizon,
<br>to the north of the Big Square of Pegasis, while using my binoculars.  There
<br>was a bright sparkling nucleus with a hazy shimmering tail streaming faint
<br>above. The tail however  looked like a fan shaped while looking in the binoculars
<br>and I could not detect  a longer  tail streaming above because possibly a few
<br>lights way off in the distance near the horizon.
<br>
<br>I wanted to take a digital picture but it was getting too light out and some
<br>of the lights in the distance would make it difficult.
<br>
<br>I was hoping to see it before it gets too faint so that I sketch if for the
<br>Comett Award Gold award I am trying to obtain. While I know I could get a photo
<br>later with more powerful telescopes, I would like to still try in the next
<br>few days from Powell Observatory now that I know we can see it that low from
<br>there. But at least I have a sketch now that I can put up on the award site I
<br>made for my Gold award which I am trying to nail down by May or June.
<br>
<br>4/28 I headed to Louisbourg observatory (20 minutes south of Kansas City on
<br>4/28) and met up with David Hudgins. He was trying to find the comet with his
<br>MUkatov 5 inch telescope and I with binoculars. It was really windy and it
<br>seemed that the windy was picking up some stuff into the sky so that is was more
<br>difficult to look for the comet then the morning before.
<br>
<br>We finally found the comet with his telescope around 4:55. The nucleus was
<br>hazy and the tail streamed out away upward through the length of the eyepiece
<br>view. It was too murky to try with my digital camera. I knew that for the next
<br>few days it would be cloudy and/or rainy so I will have to try again later.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile check out the magnificent pictures with APOD (Astronomy Pictures of
<br>the Day-http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)  and Spaceweather-
<br>http://spaceweather.com. Excellent.
<br>
<br>We did not see T7. I am looking forward to the return of T7 and seeing Q4.

<br>Living on a dark, country hilltop is great. We got up at 4:40, put on

<br>Subject: Comet Bradfield (2004 F4) this morning
<br>
<br>Went out just before 4:30am, because I can't check the sky to the east from
<br>inside anymore. There were roughly parallel streaks of clouds drifting in from
<br>the north west.and the apparent point of convergence was unfortunately quite
<br>near the azimuth of the comet. However there were quite a few seemingly cloud
<br>less areas and most of the sky seemed clear. Since the light blocker around the
<br>Not a very good location either due to the closest dusk to dawn (blocked from
<br>view but only150 feet away) being near the azimuth for viewing the comet, and
<br>the slightly foggy morning made that wonderful orange glow extend up past
<br>zenith. The degree of cloudiness increased rapidly during the minutes used to "set
<br>up".
<br>
<br>A narrow clear spot between the clouds finally let the comet be seen a few
<br>minutes before 5:00am, though it seemed like the "clear spot" wasn't really all
<br>that clear. Bradfield's head appeared only a few arc minutes across, with very
<br>little coma surrounding a fairly bright (mag. 3) pseudo nucleus. There was
<br>obvious structure seen in the tail of the comet, which appeared to extend a
<br>little less than 5 degrees. The visible tail appeared to be ion alone, not even a
<br>suggestion of dust tail was seen. After a few minutes the clouds again covered
<br>the comet.
<br>
<br>While waiting to see if another clear spot crossed the area of the comet,
<br>movement was noticed up in the north western part of the sky. Quickly turning the
<br>20X80's to track the moving bright object it was possible to view nearly an
<br>entire pass of the ISS. Most interesting to notice that during several brief
<br>periods it was possible to determine the orientation of the space station
<br>because one could clearly distinguish between the crew modules and the solar panels.
<br> After this, attention was again given to the comet, but it was not recovered
<br>due to the thin clouds and increasing twilight.
<br>
<br>Considering the viewing conditions this morning (light pollution, poor
<br>transparency, and low object altitude) this comet may well have been "naked eye"
<br>from a better  (really dark) observing  location.

<br>Well done Terry. Yes, it does extend to the edge of the frame, although

<br>three fields should do it, but when I processed the images it just kept
<br>on going :-)  I'm a bit surprised to see that you've captured this much
<br>tail though. I had a look at it from a dark site this morning, and while
<br>nice, the tail does fade fairly quickly after the first 5 degrees or so.
<br>It looks like the rest of it is quite low surface brightness; the domain
<br>the long exposure photographs unfortunately...

Well every time I tried to image Q4 it was just too bright.  I put

<br>track and stack.
<br>
<br>Still didn't show much so ran it by the AstroArt 3 Larsen-Sekanina
<br>filter and got some detail to reveal itself - a couple of shells and
<br>a hint of tail as seen here:

There have been some requests from other groups for info on FOV for

<br>viewers, you provide a bit of documentation with your image
<br>postings.
<br>
<br>Please try to supply as many of the following data as you can:
<br>1.	Date and time (UTC)
<br>2.	Location
<br>3.	Scope focal length and camera used
<br>4.	Image FOV
<br>5.	Image scale arc seconds per pixel
<br>6.	Image orientation  North up and East left is conventional
<br>7.	Image acquisition details
<br>8.	Image processing details
<br>
<br>I know this is a heck of a lot of work the first time you compile
<br>all of the information. But once you have it for just one image, you
<br>can cut and paste and edit the items for successive images and it
<br>goes real fast. Please give it a try.  We will all benefit from more

Dennis (and Dr Flescher),
<br>
<br>I also agree. These are very valid points. The first thing I look for with a new image is the photographic details - those listed by Dennis below. Sometimes a non-texted image of a comet appears and I wonder if that tail is 2* or 22*...
<br>
<br>I have been collecting various images of Q4 and T7 posted on this group in a folder for later parousal and am always stocked when the person puts the details as text on the photo (so they appear when 'saving images'). It takes a minute or two, sure, but can be sped up by creating a Word Document page with a template of photographic details on it and then copying/pasting onto the image - and changing any necessary details (date, scope, ISO, etc).
<br>
<br>If text on an image is seen as unsightly perhaps the image can be saved in two personal modes - one with text and one without...
<br>
<br>For an example see...

Dennis,
<br>
<br>This is an excellent starting point.  Here are my comments would be:
<br>
<br>Image Scale per pixel - This should be optional since some people are
<br>using film and/or reducing image scales to enable web viewing.
<br>Provided FOV is given people can get an idea of the scale, however
<br>some indication that the image was reduced should be given.
<br>
<br>Image Orientation - It is not uncommon to reorient the FOV to
<br>maximise framing of tail.  I think stating of 'PA of up' should
<br>replace this (you should also remember to ensure images haven't been
<br>mirror reversed!).
<br>
<br>Image Acquisition details:  I assume this would include exposure,
<br>Film/ISO, stacking, binning , etc.
<br>
<br>The rest of it looks fine to me.

Hello Jean-François,
<br>
<br>You have a very nice web page with excellent documentation of the
<br>images.  I like it! And thank you for the bilingual documentation.
<br>
<br>Your jpg images exhibit a bit of posterization  the image does not
<br>have enough bit depth for the degree of histogram stretch that was
<br>employed.  This usually happens when you stretch an 8-bit jpg too
<br>much.  If you do all of the processing in 16-bit FITs and then
<br>convert to jpg you should be able to avoid this effect.
<br>
<br>The rotational gradient display is very interesting.  Was that
<br>obtained with a Larson-Sekanina filter?
<br>
<br>I am looking forward to seeing more images from you.

I've added another mosaic of T7 from this morning. Despite a 50% sunlit

<br>The "anti-tail" feature in still visible and continues its rotation

Hello Dennis,
<br>
<br>Thanks for your comments.
<br>
<br>The filter I used is in the software PRISM V5 made by french amateur
<br>astronomers.
<br>I do not know if it is the Larson-Sekanina filter because the function I
<br>used is the 'Rotationnal gradient'
<br>I suppose these are the same filter...

<br>>  Hello Jean-François,
<br>>
<br>> You have a very nice web page with excellent documentation of the
<br>> images.  I like it! And thank you for the bilingual documentation.
<br>>
<br>> Your jpg images exhibit a bit of posterization  the image does not
<br>> have enough bit depth for the degree of histogram stretch that was
<br>> employed.  This usually happens when you stretch an 8-bit jpg too
<br>> much.  If you do all of the processing in 16-bit FITs and then
<br>> convert to jpg you should be able to avoid this effect.
<br>>
<br>> The rotational gradient display is very interesting.  Was that
<br>> obtained with a Larson-Sekanina filter?
<br>>
<br>> I am looking forward to seeing more images from you.

Hi,
<br>
<br>I have not been around for a while due to job, weather, family etc.
<br>etc. but tonight I got out and tried my luck with Q4. This comet
<br>really moves fast! Starguide 2000 on the coma really helped, even
<br>with a
<br>135 mm lens (5 min. x 12 in highres.). I hope you like it (first fast
<br>processing).
<br>In my 10 x 42 binocs I could see it well, visually without you really
<br>have to know where to look. I thought the brightness to be something
<br>like a diffuse 4mag.

Through a hole in the clouds I could just see the comet with averted

<br>still hold out to use the 4" refractor and stack on the stars without

Hi:
<br>
<br>I've been monitoring Q4 since 5/7:
<br>
<br>http://www.comet-track.com/q4/q4.html
<br>
<br>Q4 on 5/10 lost the 2nd ion-tail fork (seen on 5/9):

<br>http://www.comet-track.com/q4/5cmp8910.jpg
<br>http://www.comet-track.com/q4/510/28.jpg
<br>
<br>If you compare 5/8 & 5/10 images, the main ion-tail "kinked"  is there,
<br>whereas on
<br>5/9 the 2nd ion-tail suddenly appeared ("outburst").

<br>You can see that the ion-tail has branched into multiple-rays (so it's
<br>not so concentrated to
<br>make it "prominent").  Dust tail seems to have become more "brushy".

<br>Again, I tried to corroborate the above with my visual observations

Dennis,
<br>
<br>Just in case it might have misled anyone, the vacuum is used to hold
<br>the film flat, as opposed to a cold camera in which vacuum is meant to
<br>prevent frost formation.  I actually recently acquired a combo 6x9cm
<br>and 4x5" camera too, but I'm not up to speed using it just yet.  Soon
<br>however, I'll be looking for a really big comet!
<br>
<br>Regarding the annotation, I just used Photoshop to manually create the
<br>labeling on a separate layer and combined it with the image for the
<br>web version.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
For the past few months I have tried to show any comet imaged in two
<br>ways. First to show it as close to what I think natural is whether
<br>it be B&W or color which lately, haven't had much luck with, and also
<br>create a different image of each session which is submited for
<br>study. It is necessary to adjust, sometimes to the extreme, with all
<br>tools aviable to bring out very faint detail. Most will know what
<br>this is, but for those that don't PS and other software is used to do
<br>away with the parts of the comet which hide what lies hidden.
<br>Every image of each comet requires it's own set of adjustments. I'm
<br>posting an image of Q4 taken 5/11/2004 which was submitted that gives
<br>an idea of how the
<br>tail structure just below the bright washed out area of the coma is
<br>really an offset, kinked to the left kind of structure and also shows
<br>a split about 80 or so arc-min down the tail.  In this image around
<br>180 arc-min of comet is showing. We are lucky
<br>enough to have skys and a setup that allow photographs with these
<br>kinds of detail and to have them submitted and accepted for study of
<br>the solar wind.  Any way there are two links, the
<br>first is a reduced image incase you don't want to spend time loading
<br>and a second which is a full size 950kb for image quality. Even
<br>the full size was reduced before publishing from 1600pix to 1200pix
<br>wide with prop. constrained.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hi:
<br>
<br>On 5/14, my 8" f1.5 Schmidt-Camera photos (hypered TP2415 & E100S) are
<br>showing an ion-tail
<br>disconnection feature ~5 deg away from nucleus.  The ion-tail has a
<br>"fork" feature once
<br>again (last seen on 5/9).  As on 5/12, the ion-tail has multiple fine
<br>streamers.
<br>
<br>The skewed-tail is at least 2 deg (!), & has increased since my last
<br>observations on 5/12.

<br>
<br>Visually, I thought the comet wasn't as bright as previous nights.
<br>However, the photos revealed a really rich diversity in detail.  By far,
<br>the "best looking" photos so far.

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>That is really an incredible mosaic - excelent job!
<br>
<br>I imaged with a 135 mm lens at f/8 with my MX716 and the results were
<br>disappointing. The mosaic technique was obviously superior.
<br>
<br>What was the exposure time and binning for the shots?  The scope and camera?
<br>And lastly, how do you move the scope to get the proper position for the

<br>keep a star or stars in the frame and simply move them to where I
<br>need to go next.  Time consuming but it works most of the time.
<br>Thanks, Mike

Hello Mike...
<br>You are killing us folks who still live on mountains with only dial-up connections available.  I am still trying to download your latest link and it keeps timing out....and I actually have a pretty fast and reliable connection.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
On 5/18, the comet was similar to previous day (5/17), showing daily
<br>variations in ion-tail structure:
<br>
<br>http://www.comet-track.com/q4/518/518.html
<br>http://www.comet-track.com/q4/5cmp111214161718.jpg
<br>http://www.comet-track.com/q4/q4.html
<br>
<br>The ion-tail on 5/18 shows 2 closely spaced disconnection-events, which
<br>looks like a "squiggle"  There is an outer *curved fan-like* dust-tail
<br>(very faint), brought out with image-processing.  Visually in 10x50
<br>binoculars, you only see the inner "straight" dust tail.
<br>
<br>I will note that there have been disconnection-events on 3 straight
<br>observation days (5/14, 5/16, 5/17, 5/18), with the 5/17 having 2
<br>disconnection-events.
<br>
<br>Naked eye, I could barely detect the comet (it was easier with averted
<br>vision).  Q4 is definitely going down in magnitude.

Hi all,
<br>just a quick note to state that I took a wide angle image of C/2002 T7 last night (Wed 19.30 May), then fellow cometographer Ian Cooper and I traced the tail for 43 degrees up to Reticulum! The image was a single 3 minute shot @ 1600 ASA on a Canon EOS 10D with a 24mm (x1.6 = 36mm) lens at f3.5 (FOV = 51* x 34*).
<br>
<br>Problem is I just changed computers and can't update my website to show the image for a few days - so it has been placed in the CometImages Yahoo group, see..

On 5/19, the comet was similar to previous days (5/16, 5/17, 5/18),
<br>showing daily

<br>On 5/20, the comet is clearly diminished from previous days (5/16, 5/17,
<br>5/18, 5/19), the tail in 10x50 binoculars was noticeably less.
<br>Naked eye, I couldn't even detect the comet.

<br>
<br>Ion-tail is still long (6 deg), but outer portion is much fainter than
<br>previous day (5/19).
<br>The dust-tail.is still *curved fan-like*, but fainter than previous day
<br>(5/19).
<br>The skewed tail is fainter than previous day (5/19).
<br>
<br>I think I'm done with Q4.
<br>
<br>The skewed tail is a bit "offset" from the comet's head, which is similar
<br>to what happened to Hale-Bopp's dust tail (comparing March to April).  I
<br>believe it's a function of viewing geometry..Earth VS Q4's orbital plane.

Newbie here and my first real attempt at imaging a comet, and at
<br>imaging through my 180mm lens.
<br>
<br>This was also the first light for my new ATS Pier. It is very solid
<br>and stable pier. Setup was simple, all one piece construction.
<br>Balancing the pier was a little strange at first but that is
<br>something I can get used to. The 900 mount looks great on it and the
<br>height is much better the my old 54inch pier. You can check out my
<br>Equipment page for a pic.
<br>
<br>I got to my clubs dark site (Atlanta) kinda late so I opted not to
<br>do  pulse guiding and do  my alignments manually later.  One of the
<br>first things I had problems with was focusing the 180mm. It has a
<br>very smooth focuser but the critical focus zone is extremely narrow.
<br>I got it as close as I could but it took a while so I decided against
<br>a color shot.
<br>
<br>I also took some images with my Digital Rebel through my AP130.  That
<br>was fun and I hope to get another opportunity to try NEAT again with
<br>this camera. Unfortunately (and that seems to be the case a lot these
<br>days) I forgot to load ImagesPlus on my new laptop so I had no
<br>automated focusing routine. I opted to slew to Jupiter and focus on
<br>her. Got it close but not close enough so these pics didn't turn out
<br>as good as I hoped.
<br>
<br>Anyway, here is the ST10XE shot. It is only 10-1 min images. Doesn't
<br>compare to some of the great images I've seen on this board, but hey
<br>it's my first. No autoguiding. Processed in CCDSoft, reduced,
<br>debloomed, aligned on comet using centroids and combined using an Add
<br>function. Very simple pic but that is all I was looking for this
<br>night.

Hi John et el,
<br>
<br>I have now created a webpage in response to John's questions below. Please note that the reddish glow was high cloud and the white streaks are aeroplanes... John, this is the best image that I have of the tail (shorter exposures show less of a tail - see webpage), yet having said that, the tail is very evident to all that I show the image to on my laptop... If you carefully follow the extent of tail compared to a star chart then it is evident that the tail is over 40 degrees long and extends into Reticulum. If others have images of this 43* tail please let us know!!!
<br>
<br>For the webpage see...

<br>
<br>I am beginning to wonder why we have not heard (at least I haven't)

<br>I would think it to be considerable news. I'm not sure about what
<br>other readers can see on the image John has posted to the Photos
<br>section but my machine renders the reduced image as of too poor a
<br>quality to honestly reveal much of anything about the mix of apparent
<br>tail and scattered clouds. John, will you be able to post a better
<br>quality image soon?
<br>
<br>I note that such an extremely long photographic tail, at a time when
<br>only a relatively short visual one is being reported, is most
<br>unusual. The only comparable instance I can recall is the case of
<br>Comet Tomita-Gerber-Honda in 1964. In that instance, the visual tail
<br>of this 3-4 magnitude comet was generally reported as just several
<br>degrees long but photos by Alan McClure (the premier comet
<br>photographer of the day) showed a strong, 30-degree, narrow, and
<br>highly contorted tail!
<br>
<br>Is anyone else in the far south imagining T7 with wide-angle lenses?

Johannes, that color image was great.

<br>I had this information from the 22nd.  It is a series of 6x30 second
<br>exposures.  I have been working with 40 and 45 second and getting ok
<br>results but I think the 30 second exposures at this time worked a
<br>little better.  It is only a 4 part mosaic with more work on blending
<br>and detail in the first 150 arc-min of the comet.  Two links the
<br>first is a small file and the second is about 325kb.  Thanks, Mike

What I did on this image was first to set my mount to guide on the
<br>comet.  I used a feature called Smartguide that is built into the AP
<br>software.  This gave me good comet data but causes the stars to
<br>trail.  I used a sigma combine on the resulting images and this has
<br>the effect of eliminating most of the elongated star trails but keeps
<br>the comet data.  Next time I will add a delay in my acquisition
<br>sequence, this will give the effect of dashes in the stars instead of
<br>long trails.  I believe this will be easier for the sigma combine
<br>routine to reject more of the star trails.  This was done on all the
<br>LRGB images.
<br>
<br>The next series was taken to give me a good star field.  I set the
<br>mount/camera to autoguide.  This resulting image gave me good star
<br>data but a poor comet image.  I again used sigma combine.  I used
<br>levels in PS to bring up the stars but intentionally kept the comet
<br>image low.  The resulting LRGB was an image of just the stars.
<br>
<br>The next thing I did was to layer the star image on top of the star-
<br>less comet image.  I used a Light blending option in PS.  This added
<br>the stars to the comet image. A little curves and the effect is that
<br>you have a cool comet image with round stars.
<br>
<br>The bright star you see in the tail was very bright and caused a lot
<br>of problems.  I had to use a lot of layering techniques and cloning
<br>to get it to look this good.  Unfortunately I only had a limited time
<br>to image the comet so I could not wait for it to pass by this star.
<br>The technique I used can be found on Ron Wodowski's New CCD Astronomy
<br>web page.
<br>
<br>Any other techniques would be greatly appreciated as this is very new
<br>to me.  A friend of mine, Roth Ritter, taught me this way, I am sure
<br>there are others......

Hello,
<br>I was asked off-list by several people to add some explanations
<br>about the meaning of the image listed below. Well, may be that also
<br>others in this group will be interested on it...
<br>
<br>Essentially the picture shows how different narrowband filters are
<br>capable to isolate the emission of molecular species (and dust) at
<br>discrete wavelenghts. This tecnique is normally used by professional
<br>astronomers to calculate the fluxes/chemical abundances in cometary
<br>comae. For us amateurs, the main problem with narrowband
<br>interference filters is due to the fact that they cut a large amount
<br>of light, so we can normally use them only on bright targets (but
<br>the diffusion of back-illuminated CCDs has the potentials to change
<br>this situation).
<br>
<br>For this particular image, I think that's interesting to see at
<br>first the three upper panels: they show how in the 390nm filter
<br>(strong CN emission line) and in the 515nm filter (strong C2
<br>emission band) the coma has a nearly round aspect, while in the
<br>647nm filter (where we see almost no gas contribution but mainly the
<br>dust continuum) the shape is very different (parabolic shape). This
<br>is a well known effect: the gas component in the coma is normally
<br>distributed more simmetrically than the dust, and it's capable to
<br>travel for longer distances.
<br>
<br>The two panels below show some details in the very beginning of the
<br>tail: the 620nm filter (noticeable H2O+ emission lines) is capable
<br>to increase the details of the ion tail forming streamers, that are
<br>not visible in the 647nm filter where the broad dust tail overwhelms
<br>the ionic contribution.
<br>
<br>Normally in order to obtain the "pure footprint" of each chemical
<br>component, is necessary to substract from the given element/molecule
<br>narrowband filter the nearest continuum emission. This is needed to
<br>purge them from the dust continuum (present with different
<br>intensities along all the visible spectra). This isn't an easy
<br>operation, and it requires some practice. I didn't make this
<br>operation yet, however the contribution of the dust continuum for
<br>the CN and C2 filters is very small compared to that of the emission
<br>lines themselves. But this becames mandatory if one would like to
<br>calculate the actual fluxes originated by the cometary chemicals,
<br>but this stage is one step further for me. For now my main
<br>interested was to evidence some interesting morphological features
<br>in this comet. The adoption of narrowband interference filters was
<br>strongly encouraged by some professionals operating within the CARA
<br>collaboration (http://cara.uai.it/): the ambitous target is to be
<br>able to extract cometary
<br>fluxes data also with amateurs means. Let's see if it will work...
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni Sostero (Remanzacco Observatory, Italy)

<br>I have the rgb pics of T7 from 5/29 and will have a color picture up on my

<br>tonight I tried C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) with my 135mm lens at f/3.5 and MX7c
<br>for 10 x 5 min. (highres. selfguide on a star). This is my first

Hi Everyone,
<br>                I imaged Comet C/2003-K4 (LINEAR) last night using my C9.25 &
<br>SAC-8. Here is a link to the images;
<br>

<br>And here are the same images in negative with slightly stretched contrast to

<br>
<br>North is roughly to the right (I didn't orientated my camera logically when I
<br>took the images... :-)
<br>
<br>       Despite moonlight the comet was nice visually in the scope at medium
<br>power appearing as a faint smudge, slightly elongated.
<br>
<br>Best wishes & clear skies,

<br>got up between moonset and sunrise this morning to image Comet 2004 H6 (SWAN). As I waited for it to rise I also shot NGC 253 - the large galaxy in Sculptor.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I imaged  C/2003 K4 LINEAR on 7 June at 0534 UT.  C-11 scope at f/5
<br>and MX716 CCD camera.  A small movie is included on my New Image
<br>Page linked below to illustrate the relative motion of the comet.
<br>
<br>On my web page linked below, I illustrate how I achieve proper image
<br>orientation of a comet relative to the star field using a
<br>planetarium program. The images were acquired with a CCD but the
<br>technique is applicable to all imaging modalities.
<br>
<br>It is considered good practice to present one's images with a North
<br>up/East left orientation.  I had a really hard time doing this at
<br>first and have gradually learned how.  I image with different scopes
<br>so I have to contend with rotation and mirroring of the image, along
<br>with occasional rotation.
<br>
<br>I hope you find this useful. It is on the New Images Page so it will
<br>be gone in a week or so.

</pre>

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hi all,
<br>
<br>I have been asked to give two seperate talks on the recent bright comets (2001 Q4 and 2002 T7) - one at New Zealand's Royal Astronomical Societies conference (2-4 July - http://www.rasnz.org.nz/ ). I have been downlading all the wonderful images of these comets over the last few months and was wondering if anyone objected to me using them in the talks (full credit will be given for images used of course). I hope to have a NZ (and Australian) flavour with the images, but need some photos from other parts of this planet to fill in the gaps (especially now that Q4 has gone north).
<br>
<br>I was thinking that if anyone OBJECTS to me using their image(s) please contact me offline at the email address below and I won't use your images...
<br>
<br>Cheers.

I have viewed the images from 06/11/2004 and knew there was more.
<br>Having put together all images which total 24x45 sec exp, we now have
<br>a better idea of what this comet is doing at well over 2au from the
<br>Sun.  There is a short dust tail at the 7 o'clock position and two
<br>tails showing at 6 and 5 pm.  I give this with the image being
<br>positioned with  north up   The kinked longer tail covers a at least
<br>25 arc-min as the image is 56 arc-min tall.  Rough, I know but this
<br>shows what might be an exciting comet to watch over the next couple
<br>of months considering what is out there as we know it now.  Thanks,

Hi
<br>Back from Namibia I needed some time to stack all these images. I had a

<br>Since the camera stacks 128 half frames on board, 20 minutes of video
<br>consist of roughly 500 images. These were (after flat field correction)
<br>stacked using Fitswork.

</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hi,
<br>
<br>Has anyone imaged the ion tail of C/2003 K4 in the last day or two?
<br>Observing from Table Mountain Observatory in Wrightwood, CA last
<br>night, there appeared to be a disconnection event visible in the ion
<br>tail in unflatfielded images. At ~0700 UT on April 22, the feature was
<br>approximately 9 arcminutes south of the nucleus.
<br>
<br>As the phase angle is low, there is a good chance of being able to
<br>follow this feature for some days, as the line of sight is quite close
<br>to the ion tail axis. If anyone obtained images recently, or plans to
<br>do so in the coming days, please get in touch. We'd like to trace the
<br>time of appearance of this feature, and measure its velocity down the
<br>tail.
<br>
<br>See http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/Request.html
<br>for details of why we're interested in tracing ion tail features.
<br>
<br>Images of C/2001 Q4 and C/2002 T7 also continue to be very welcome.
<br>Many thanks,

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
With everyone imaging very bright Q4 NEAT these days, I opted for a
<br>much dimmer comet:  C/2003 G1 LINEAR at magnitude 17.0 per Seiichi
<br>Yoshida, http://www.aerith.net/comet/weekly/current.html
<br>
<br>The image is a stack of one 5 minute and one 3 minute unguided
<br>frames taken with the C-11 at f/5 and MX716 camera.  I later looked
<br>up the relative motion and found it was only 0.004 arc seconds per
<br>minute.  I could have taken 5 hour's worth of images, aligned on the
<br>stars, and not blurred the comet!  A movie of this one would be very
<br>boring!
<br>
<br>Now that I have a goto mount, I can just Recal on a nearby star, key
<br>in the faint comet's coordinates, and be assured that it is in the
<br>FOV of the camera. Yea!

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>I don't think I'll be able to image C/2003 T4 LINEAR from my
<br>northern Illinois site. At darkness, it is only 24.8 degrees above
<br>the horizon and sinking.
<br>
<br>Sorry to hear about the storm damage.  That reminds me that I should
<br>up the coverage on the observatory in my homeowner's policy.  Added

Hi Dennis,

<br>Both pictures have two guidelines? By comparing the region of the

<br>I presumed the 8" f/300 nomenclature represented the effective focal

Hi Stefan,

<br>My confusion arises from non-standard nomenclature:  Generally f/

Eric.  I don't know if the tail has grown in the past week or if my
<br>seeing was just better at the time of these images.  I would suspect
<br>it has increased but the weather has been so bad for months around

<br>
<br>Hello Stefan,
<br>I upload an image of C/2003 G1 (LINEAR) obtained on July 19.0, 2004
<br>in the "Photos" area of this mailing-list's homepage. it seems that
<br>the comet is faintly visible in my frame. On the POSS-R plate for
<br>that coordinates, there is nothing in that position, so I think I
<br>really catched the comet.
<br>Ciao,
<br>Giovanni

Hello Dennis.  These images were taken just before Moonrise.  About 1

<br>could be posted.  Each of these comet images is a 10x60 sec exp.  the
<br>approx time was 0300UT 08022004.  74x56 arc-min 4" @F5.3 - 530mm. N
<br>is up.  Temp in the dome was 38cel so cooling & noise was a problem

Hi all,
<br>
<br>I'm writing an article for the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand's ( http://www.rasnz.org.nz/ ) journal 'Southern Stars' on comets Q4 and T7. The slant is that I'm using mainly New Zealand and some Australian cometphotos. However I need an image of Hale Bopp with a display of both the gas and dust tails to illustrate a point. Does anyone have a 'great' image that I could use?
<br>
<br>Also I want to use one of Johannes Schedlers (Panther Observatory) images. I have sent him an email asking if I may use it, however I've received no reply at this stage (I presume I reached him). Johannes, if you read this could you please reply to the email address below?
<br>
<br>Also I wanted to use the great image of Comet Bradfield, T7, and M31 by Mr Niebling. Could he also possibly allow me to use it by contacting me?

<br>I'm afraid I'm under a bit of a deadline pressure and need to submit the artcile within the next five days...

<br>Hi all,
<br>
<br>I'm writing an article for the Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand's (
<br>http://www.rasnz.org.nz/ ) journal 'Southern Stars' on comets Q4 and T7. The
<br>slant is that I'm using mainly New Zealand and some Australian cometphotos.
<br>However I need an image of Hale Bopp with a display of both the gas and dust
<br>tails to illustrate a point. Does anyone have a 'great' image that I could
<br>use?
<br>
<br>Also I want to use one of Johannes Schedlers (Panther Observatory) images. I
<br>have sent him an email asking if I may use it, however I've received no
<br>reply at this stage (I presume I reached him). Johannes, if you read this
<br>could you please reply to the email address below?
<br>
<br>Also I wanted to use the great image of Comet Bradfield, T7, and M31 by Mr
<br>Niebling. Could he also possibly allow me to use it by contacting me?
<br>
<br>I'm afraid I'm under a bit of a deadline pressure and need to submit the
<br>artcile within the next five days...
<br>
<br>Thanks to all.
<br>
<br>Cheers.

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>After seeing your T4, I was going to image it tonight. Then I
<br>noticed that it would only be 21 degrees above the horizon at
<br>transit!   That's too low for me at mag 14.3.
<br>

Hi Mike,

<br>That is a very interesting mosaic.  I'd like to try something like
<br>that some time but I have a hard time joining the sections of images
<br>together.  It gets especially hard when I image on different nights

<br>
<br>What software did you use and how did you handle rotation?

Hello Dennis.   I took images for about 3 weeks before the final set
<br>was taken on 8/24/2004.  If I had not had Photoshop7, I could not
<br>have done this.  A big problem was turning the information of about
<br>5x60 seconds for each frame into a single image which showed the same
<br>magnitude of all objects.  Some frames required 20 or 30x60 sec. exp
<br>like the M81 and M82 images.  Gradients were a big problem with all
<br>frames being no more than 25 or 30 deg. off the horizion over a three
<br>(?) week period.  It took hours of working with each set of exposures
<br>to create a single frame and then adding it to each aditional frame
<br>next to it.  Once I thought I had a match and looked at the entire
<br>mosaic I basicly had to start over for the benefit of the entire
<br>image.  I came to a point where my own self judgment became to tough
<br>to handle so I then showed it to all.  I also took all the color info
<br>for each frame but gave up on that a long time ago.  I am pleased to
<br>be able to use a 4" refractor and acheve an almost 18th magnitude

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I just learned from the Comets ML group that the comet magnitudes
<br>as given in planetarium programs are subject to large errors. As I
<br>understand it, the errors can occur even with the most recent
<br>ephemeredes because the data from the Harvard.edu site concerns
<br>itself only with astrometry, and not photometry.  Many comets do not
<br>follow the expected light curve, and thus the calculated magnitude
<br>can differ greatly from the actual.
<br>
<br>I experienced this difference first hand on Aug 23, 2004, when I
<br>tried to image C/2004 H6 SWAN. Sky Map Pro 10 lists the magnitude at
<br>10.4  When I tried to image the comet, there was nothing there!  I
<br>thought my goto mount had gotten lost or something.
<br>
<br>Then, I come to learn that on Aug. 23, the magnitude of H6 was of
<br>the order of 17.8 (nuclear magnitude) as given on
<br>http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/LastCometObs.html
<br>
<br>I believe the magnitude difference of 7.3 explains why there was no
<br>comet in my image.
<br>
<br>Now I understand why at times I have failed to image a comet that
<br>seemed to be bright enough for my equipment and skies.  It is
<br>because the comet was, in fact, much dimmer than my planetarium
<br>programs calculated.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">

<br> Inspired by  Vello's mail to comet-ml I thought about more pre-discovery
<br>images of
<br>2004  Q2, and looked where it was located in Mid May 2004. I think a number
<br>of
<br> folks who were at the southern hemisphere for observing 2002 T7 might have
<br> captured  comet Machholz, too. On May 14 and 15, for instance, was just 12
<br>degrees
<br> from T7. On May 15 it was actually pretty much inside comet 2002 T7's
<br>ail.
<br>
<br> I looked on my own Mintron photos, but unfortunately the 2004 Q2 position
<br> was just outside the field of view of my 50mm lens. There were a number of
<br> folks using 100mm lenses on a 300D camera or something like this and made
<br> mosaiks to cover much of the 2002 T7 tail.
<br>
<br> They should really look for prediscovery images of the comet, which is
<br> predicted to have been 14 mag. Maybe some images turn up !

<br>Nice shot. I caught comet Machholz in B&W ccd   image last night at 4:33
<br>arizona time. I was surprised to see it however on the left side of my image .
<br>That leads me to believe that my coordinates with starry night pro program are
<br>off as it should have been near the center.
<br>In any case, I noticed the comet on the left side because of the small fan
<br>shaped tail like the pic you have so thanks.
<br>I will try to put the pics and others in the coming week. I am still looking
<br>for Tucker Q1.

<br>
<br>Thanks to Michael Jaeger and Gerald Rhemann for these latest images.
<br>
<br>Don't hesitate to report errors  accessing files of the comet section to me.
<br>With every reported error I can improve the image gallery.

Very nice images Stefan.
<br>
<br>In Portugal the last couple of Saturdays we've been clouded so it's nice to follow these comets trough your pics.
<br>
<br>Next Saturday if the weather permits I'll try to image 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann and 78P/Gehrels.

Hi:

<br>Managed to image both comets yesterday, and 29P has had a big change in

<br>  My orentation is not perfectly N up and E to the left but it is

<br>Hello Eric.  My post contained the comet, date and time.  I will in
<br>the future state the comet name a little clearer in the text.  It is
<br>C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)from 10/03/2004 - 0200UT.  It is a good target still
<br>sitting in the area of Ursa Major just after dark.  The cordinates I
<br>used at the time of the imaging was RA 14-21-44   DC +67-55-02.
<br>
<br>The comet is listed at Magnitude 9.2.  Above and to the right is a
<br>double looking set of stars GSC 4403 1132 at magnitude 11.34 and GSC
<br>4403 1118 at magnitude 10.77.  Below and to the right of the comet is
<br>GSC 4403-1103 at magnitude 7.31 and next to it on it's right is GSC
<br>4403 1097 1 at magnitude 11..  The orentation of the image is basicly
<br>N-up and E to the left.  Thanks, Mike H.

<br>Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>I was just considering imaging Q4 tonight so I referred to your
<br>image. You might consider a more aggressive histogram stretch as it
<br>looks a bit dark on my monitor.  I stretched the image and brought
<br>out a tail that extends for half the image height, which must be
<br>around 15 arc minutes. I hope the tail is still there tonight!

<br>Hello Dennis,
<br>nice shot, indeed. It seems to me that the coma is somehow elongated. Have you tried to elaborate the image with a rotational-gradient algorithm (like Larson-Sekanina)?

<br>Hello Giovanni,
<br>
<br>I noticed the possible elongation of the coma but I was not sure if
<br>perhaps it was an artifact due to the influence of a nearby star.  I
<br>have not yet learned how to apply the very powerful Larson-Sekanina
<br>algorithm which I have in AstroArt 3.0.  I would be very grateful if

<br>Greetings.  Weather permitting I have imaged this comet as often as I

<br>Particularly I find very interesting the image that reproduces the new 29P outburst.
<br>
<br>Would someone in this list know me to explain how come a comet that is distant 5-6 UAs from the Sun continues to have these visible periodic outbursts every year (that precedent has happened ago less than one month)?

Hi Rolando,
<br>
<br>29P has been very active over the past couple of years at least.
<br>My guess is that there is a fresh CO2 rich area exposed on the surface that
<br>rotates into sunlight periodically.
<br>Perhaps you should ask this question to the comet group.

<br>You have a very interesting and informative web site.
<br>
<br>I am also interested in imaging 78P when the moon subsides. What
<br>scope, camera and acquisition time did you use?  Also, how dark are
<br>your skies?  My visual limiting magnitude varies from about 2.5 to
<br>4.0.

<br>Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>I don't see anything. Guide 8 tells you what the relative motion is
<br>(More Info) and for S1 it is 7 arc minutes /hour = 7 arc seconds per
<br>minute. So it should smear of 42 arc seconds length on your image.
<br>It isn't there. You do have some hot pixels that come and go and

<br>
<br>There is some software called Astrometrica that is perfect for
<br>finding dim comets. I have not figured out how to use it but someday
<br>I might. But honestly, I'd rather be able to see the comet in my
<br>image instead of having some software package tell me it's there!

<br>Hay Dennis.  Look at the image taken by Michael J. on the 7th.  No
<br>info was given but the faint nature of so many stacks for this comet,

<br>Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>I agree that 15 mag should be within your reach.  I think we have
<br>both discovered that comets that we should be able to image
<br>sometimes just don't turn out.  In particular, if you can't see the
<br>comet in each frame, there is no way to visually stack on the head,
<br>so many exposures don't help. That's where you need Astrometrica
<br>which calculates where the comet should be and stacks according to
<br>the orbital parameters.
<br>
<br>I find that I can easily loose a magnitude or more of delectability
<br>if the sky transparency is not good or if the comet is low and
<br>oriented towards the Chicago area.
<br>
<br>Clear skies,
<br>

Hello,
<br>about C/2001 Q4 (NEAT): it's worth to notice how on October 23 there was the crossing of the orbital plane of this comet by Earth. According Luigi Pansecchi (CARA-Italian Comet Section) the conditions for the detection of a possible anti-tail will last for several days further. If anyone of you have images spanning from Oct.21 to Oct.27, please notify it.

<br>Hi Stefan,
<br>
<br>What was the comet's elevation and angular separation from the moon
<br>when you tried on the 24th?
<br>
<br>Seiichi Yoshida
<br>http://www.aerith.net/comet/weekly/current.html
<br>says m1=14.4. If the nucleus is not a point source but rather an
<br>extended source, then it seems possible that you could image 16.5
<br>magnitude stars and still miss the comet.  Perhaps others can better
<br>explain the discrepancy.

<br>Greetings.  Please let me say that the Comet-Images board does not
<br>apply to "pretty images" only.   This board was created at a time
<br>when the comet-ml board was being overun with post and images which
<br>did not apply to the issue of the discussion of comets.  I talked to
<br>Maik and we agree that each issue has it's place.  Discussion, images
<br>and observations.  Please be assured that the comet-images board is a
<br>place for individual's images and sketches.  This includes all images
<br>from all individuals. Here we do not judge good or bad.  Past
<br>experience shows that all images are of value, sometimes more than
<br>you know.  We only ask that you explain the processing of the images
<br>so that the value of each image can be applied if needed.  I have
<br>noticed images being loaded to the photo and file section which go
<br>unposted therefore unoticed. Please post a note or link for these so
<br>the members can take advantage of your work.  If we all work
<br>together, all comet boards will function appropriately especially
<br>with brighter comets in the future.  Thanks, Mike Holloway

<br>A Comet Turns On
<br>
<br>What began as the routine discovery of a near-Earth asteroid on October
<br>10th took on a curious and dramatic twist a month later when the new find
<br>suddenly developed a narrow tail. Franco Mallia, Gianluca Masi, and Roger
<br>Wilcox first spotted the pencil-thin appendage in CCD images they'd taken
<br>on November 11th with a 0.36-meter reflector at Las Campanas Observatory,
<br>Chile. The tail independently turned up in CCD frames taken less than a
<br>day later by Juan Lacruz in La Canada, Spain. No one yet knows what caused
<br>the tail to form (two other asteroids-turned-comets,
<br>107P/Wilson-Harrington and 133P/Elst-Pizarro, have been discovered in
<br>recent decades). But observers are certain it wasn't there when Rob
<br>McNaught first recorded the asteroid, designated 2004 TU12, using a
<br>0.5-meter Schmidt telescope at Australia's Siding Spring Observatory. A
<br>preliminary orbit issued by the Minor Planet Center puts Comet Siding
<br>Spring (now bearing the official comet designation P/2004 TU12) between
<br>the orbits of Earth and Mars, near the perihelion of a looping,
<br>5.3-year-long track. At 14th magnitude, it's too faint to be seen visually
<br>in small telescopes.

<br>Mike,
<br>
<br>The comet was moving very slowly.  It's near the point where the
<br>orbital track loops back on itself from our viewpoint.  It's not
<br>obvious, but each individual shot of 45 minutes is actually tracked on
<br>the comet although the stars look like they have barely trailed.
<br>
<br>As far as film images are concerned, the stacking will only be
<br>possible when a comet is positioned well away from the horizon.  Most
<br>comets are too close to the horizon for a sequence of shots and are
<br>buried in the twilight glow gradient which causes havoc in combining
<br>shots.

<br>Here from us they were two months that the stars were not seen because was always covered

<br>Hello Rolando.  On the SXV M25 is developing a strong positive
<br>impression.  The only limitation is that sensitivity may be reduced because
<br>of the color format of the chip.  This is one problem I have with the H9c -
<br>the luminance in 25% as sensitive as the monochrome camera.  I wonder if I
<br>had used the H9 monochrome to take this image, would the tail have been
<br>more distinct.  I would wait to see if Starlight comes up with a monochrome
<br>version of the camera.
<br>
<br>Looking forward to seeing your images -- when the skies clear.

Rolando - processing of images from color CCD cameras can be more
<br>challenging and the sensitivity is reduced relative to monochrome; however,
<br>in the field, there is no need to play around with filters, refocusing, or
<br>loosing data because of changing conditions.  I prefer to keep thinks

Hi all,
<br>
<br>this is ancient history, but some of you may recall that I wrote an article on Comets LINEAR (2001 Q4) and NEAT's (2002 T7) close aspiration earlier this year (for The Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand's 'Southern Stars' journal (Volume 43, No. 3 - 2004 September)) and asked for some people to contribute images. Well, the journal came out about two months ago and I have recently sent complimentary copies to those folk whose images featured in the article - namely Terry Lovejoy, Frank and Karin Niebling, Gerald Rhemann, and Vello Tabur. For the others who did submit images and they weren't included, I am so sorry that they were not published but my hands were tied by the space/cost constraints of the editor.
<br>
<br>My sincere thanks to all who submitted photos...

Greetings all
<br>
<br>I took this color picture with the RGB pics with the Harvard scope I use.
<br>Comet Machholz if between 6-7 magnitude and possibly is expected to go to mag 4
<br>later in Dec. It is looking bright with a nice nucleus and faint coma but no
<br>tail. It is light yellow-green-white.
<br>My pic is at
<br>http://members.aol.com/kcstarguy/satoriastronomy/cometaward3.htm
<br>On my main web page and others, I have pics of Ikeya Zhang, F4, Q4 and many
<br>others.
<br>There are several other nice comets in the sky currently. If you are
<br>interested in gaining the Silver award by the Astronomy League that I created, please
<br>contact me and I will send you additional information. You need to be a member
<br>of the AL or a astro society linked to the AL to gain the awards.
<br>Silver award winners (need 12 comets(   get   our real cool comet award pin
<br>and a signed certificate of Hale-Bopp. There is a Gold award too.
<br>
<br>With all the comets lately since 2001, I think many of you would be well on
<br>the way to earning a comet award.
<br>It is a lot of fun to hunt comets and capture them on your CCD, camera or
<br>illustrate them. Looking forward to hearing from you all.

Hello all
<br>in spite of the bright moonlight, few hours ago we imaged C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) with a Cousins I filter. There is clear evidence of an arch-like strucure emerging from the central condensation in PA 330 deg, and extending at least 10 arcmin toward west, north-west, in a spiral-like feature. The image is available in the Photos area of this mailing-list homepage, in the folder Remanzacco Observatory.

Excellent image Mike....the comet is so very low in the south now that you did an excellent job; we posted an unprocessed (astrometric) image on the ASO website ( www.arksky.org ) to show a comparison of the large coma with the very well defined nucleus of this comet from last night as well; it gives a sense of the development of the core of the comet in relation to the extended coma cloud....

<br>> A Comet Turns On
<br>>
<br>> What began as the routine discovery of a near-Earth asteroid on
<br>October
<br>> 10th took on a curious and dramatic twist a month later when the
<br>new find
<br>> suddenly developed a narrow tail. Franco Mallia, Gianluca Masi, and
<br>Roger
<br>> Wilcox first spotted the pencil-thin appendage in CCD images they'd
<br>taken
<br>> on November 11th with a 0.36-meter reflector at Las Campanas
<br>Observatory,
<br>> Chile. The tail independently turned up in CCD frames taken less
<br>than a
<br>> day later by Juan Lacruz in La Canada, Spain. No one yet knows what
<br>caused
<br>> the tail to form (two other asteroids-turned-comets,
<br>> 107P/Wilson-Harrington and 133P/Elst-Pizarro, have been discovered
<br>in
<br>> recent decades). But observers are certain it wasn't there when Rob
<br>> McNaught first recorded the asteroid, designated 2004 TU12, using a
<br>> 0.5-meter Schmidt telescope at Australia's Siding Spring
<br>Observatory. A
<br>> preliminary orbit issued by the Minor Planet Center puts Comet
<br>Siding
<br>> Spring (now bearing the official comet designation P/2004 TU12)
<br>between
<br>> the orbits of Earth and Mars, near the perihelion of a looping,
<br>> 5.3-year-long track. At 14th magnitude, it's too faint to be seen
<br>visually
<br>> in small telescopes.

<br>Thanks Mike. I found it interesting the difference in detail between

<br>Hello Mike,
<br>interesting image. You may be aware that on [Comets-ml] Seiichi Yoshida has prompted a discussion about the tail of this comet. Please, can you give some additonal details about your image, like UT of the exposure, orientation, etc.?

<br>Giovanni. The image is a composit of 5x40 second exp.  The third of
<br>five was logged with ccdops at 00:35:59 - 12/02/2004.  I used the 4"
<br>FSQ refractor at F5.3 - 530mm.  The correct orentation would be N to
<br>the left of the image and E down.  I have the tail at 5.522' with a
<br>PA of 351.6 deg.  The camera is an ST2000XM and when used on the FSQ
<br>gives a FOV of 74x56 arc-min.  I have rotated the image and loaded it
<br>at the link  http://www.fototime.com/1104E2D2840B86E/orig.jpg  for
<br>viewing.  The original files are FITS and as always I will provide
<br>them to anyone who would like them.  Hope this helps, Mike H.

<br>Sorry about that.  Don't know why I can't hit the correct link when
<br>loading.  I am having some problems with color.  It could be the
<br>comet being low or as you know the weather changing so rapidly around
<br>here, I can't seem to figure it out.  One session it almost appears
<br>blue and the next night under the same clear skys there is almost no
<br>sign of any tails and the color is red & green.  Setting my star
<br>colors is about the only way figure what the comet looks like and
<br>right now it is hard to do that.   Anyway at this time the colors
<br>reminds me of WM1.  Mike

</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hello all,
<br>yesterday night we imaged C/2004Q2 (Machholz) trhough narrowband filters centered at 513.5nm (C2 emission) and 645nm (dust continuum). I post the final result in the "photo" section of this m-l homepage, within the "Remanzacco Observatory" folder.
<br>
<br>It's interesting to notice how the comet head morphology changes as seen with different filters: the C2 emissions (cleaned from dust contaminations) shows a very extended coma, with a relatively small gradient, while the dust coma is oriented differently and its gradient is very steep.
<br>
<br>To be noticed also a nice spiral-like feature emanating from the central condensation, not visible in the C2 emission. In the latter there is some structure, but the signal is very weak.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni Sostero (Remanzacco Observatory, Italy)

</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hello all,
<br>I upload in the "Photos" section (Remanzacco Observatory folder) a composit image about C/2004Q2 (Machholz) obtained on Dec. 6 and 7 from our observatyory. The panels show the evolution of the inner part of the coma as seen through a narrowband interference filter centered on the dust continuum (645nm, FWHM 10nm).
<br>
<br>The structures are evidenced:
<br>1) subtracting from the original image a model of the coma (obtained with the canonical 1/r power law); what is left are brighhtness dishomogeneouties of the coma (active areas)
<br>2) subtracting from the original image a frame of the coma, obtained averaging the ADUs along the cometocentric radius
<br>
<br>These two algorithms, developed by Martino Nicolini (Italian Comet Section, CARA) has demonstrated to be less invasive than the standard Larson-Sekanina radial filtering. They preserve the photometric properties of the original image and, moreover, they are less sensitives to the production of artefatcs.
<br>
<br>In this instance, it's possible to see a kind of spiral structure emanating from the central condensation of the comet. A fountain-like feature is seen in the solar direction. The same structures are not seen in the C2 narrowband filter (centered @513.5nm, FWHM 10nm), so they are likely due (mainly)  to dust. Blinking the images, there is evidence of a counterclockwise rotation/expansion of the spiral feature.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni Sostero (Remanzacco Observatory, Italy)

<br>Yes they do, but I needed to train the mount for small errors so I
<br>just figured why waste sky time.    If anyone is interested, I hooked
<br>the ST2KXM to a 135mm nikon lense and took 2x180 second images.
<br>You are correct,  the addictive part is there.  To have images
<br>without star movement is nice but I cannot allow the ease to overcome
<br>the detail which I am after.  Thanks for the reminder.   Mike H.

Amateurs astronomers who are members of the   Astronomical League (either a
<br>member or are members through another society in the US or abroad) are welcome
<br>to earn a Silver and Gold award Comet Observers Awared certificate for their
<br>observations and data recorded concerning comets.
<br>
<br>To get started with the comet award
<br>photograph with camera or CCD or illustrate or a combination of those
<br>record data about each comet
<br>(see sample page and print out at <
<br>http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/comet/comet.htm>)
<br>
<br>(1) Silver award (you get the our cool AL comet award pin and the silver
<br>certificate with Hale-Bopp comet which makes a nice certicate to frame). You need
<br>to gain 12 comets. 2 can be gained before Jan 2001. The rest for the silver
<br>need to be after 2001.
<br>
<br>(2) You can illustrate the comets (there are sketch models on the comet award
<br>page), or use CCD or camera pictures or mix and match . Images can be placed
<br>on a CD, website or mix and match. You can do these with binoculars, big
<br>scopes, naked eye or mix and match.
<br>
<br>(3) Once you are ready for the award (have 12 comets) put the list down on
<br>the comet page and send to me.

<br>a decline in the brightness of the tail which is pointing to the N.
<br>If so could this be due to position of the comet and will the dust

<br>An image from early this morning UT.  Info is on the picture.  Has
<br>any one noticed this comet not being at the cordinates.  According to
<br>Guide 8 and compairing it with my image (linked below), this comet is
<br>about 13.5 arc-min S/E of where it should be.
<br>  The reason I ask is Steve Cox contact me last night and after a
<br>year or so of not being on his scope he is now going to image faint
<br>comets again.  His 12" and ccd have a small fov and he was having a
<br>problem placing the comet on the chip.  Thanks, Mike H.

<br>
<br>Thanks Mike. Well, the DSLR are nice for this kind of images: they have large chips, and you obtain the color image with only one shot. The drawback is that they are not cooled, so normally you are forced to stack a large amount of frames in order to reduce the noise. I also found that if you don't have a large computer RAM (mine is 256Mb "only"), it will take a long time for the image processing: I took the original frames in raw format, and transforming them into FIT (for treatment with Astroart), pumped they size to 32Mb. So I spent almost whole this Sunday afternoon just to substract the darks and combine them into an average final image. It's likely that Santa will be asked for some more RAM by the udersigned...
<br>
<br>About the tail brightness decline: I think that this is due to, at least, a couple of reasons: i) some vignetting of the telephoto lens, ii) a real decline in the tail brightness.
<br>The dust tail development: during next weeks we have the perihelium passage and the phase angle of comet Machholz should increase, so it's likely that we will see a nice development of the dust tail. Also the ion tail, already impressive, should became more prominent. Prepare your wide field lens...
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

<br>How come a refractor image has 4-way diffraction spikes?
<br>
<br>Did you place a "cross" made from wires in front of the objective.

</pre>

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Dear All,
<br>I'm pleased to introduce the first light images of the Campocatino Austral
<br>Observatory (CAO) telescope, a 0.5-f/3 fully robotic instrument that our team
<br>has recently installed in Chile, not-too-far from San Pedro de Atacama, under
<br>one the best skies in the world.
<br>
<br>It is hosted at the SPACE (www.spaceobs.com) facility and its current setup
<br>provides a 1-square-degree FOV, suited for NEO searches from the south and for
<br>wide field imaging. The OTA, mounted on a Software Bisque's Paramount ME, is
<br>equipped with an Apogee AP8p CCD camera. Its MPC code is I10.
<br>
<br>These nights Gianluca Masi, Franco Mallia (Campo Catino Observatory, Italy) and
<br>Alain Maury (Gene Shomeaker Observatory and SPACE owner, Chile) had the first
<br>light with this telescope, choosing as target the comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz).
<br>This nice object was imaged more than 260 times over ~3.5 hours, to make both a
<br>movie and a still image. In the former, we have been able to beautifully record
<br>the evolution of the ion tail, so it is worth to check.
<br>
<br>The images are visible here:
<br>http://www.bellatrixobservatory.org/c2004q2c2004r2.html
<br>
<br>Please note that the official page will be this one:
<br>http://www.campocatinobservatory.org/c2004q2c2004r2oac.html
<br>as soon as I will have fixed some server problems.
<br>
<br>In the latter site we will also present our instrument in more details (at the
<br>moment, only a short description in Italian is available).
<br>
<br>Thank you for your attention and clear skies,
<br>
<br>Gianluca Masi
<br>on the behalf of Campocatino Astronomical Observatory

<br>I believe my shot on "12/14", taken @3:00am PST on 12/15 (corresponds to

<br>on 12/15 20.xx UT(See post below).  His was taken slightly later, about

<br>
<br>Note how the tail had changed 24 hrs later, from my locality (see above

<br>Very interesting..  The ion tail is showing some very dynamic behavior,

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">

<br>I am posting an image of Comet Machholz. This is my fist comet
<br>image. It was taken with an STL11k, FSQ 106, STV guider, and AP1200
<br>mount. It was taken from Lockwood Valley, CA at approximately 11 PM.
<br>http://home.earthlink.net/~rickwiggins/
<br>I was imaging several other targets better suited to this OTA and
<br>camera, but stopped between targets to have a go at the comet.
<br>Exposures are one set of LRGB at 210 Secs. each and binned 3x3. More
<br>exposure would really have helped, but I thought this was all the
<br>time I could risk and not smear the comet too much. Comments and
<br>critique encouraged.

<br>Gerald,
<br>Good image. What sub-exposure time did you use? I expect you may
<br>have a lot more detail in your raw images than this shows. DId you
<br>track on the stars, or did you make this image from 2 sets of data
<br>(one tracked on the comet and one tracked on the stars)?

<br>Thanks, Rick,
<br>
<br>I shoot from very light polluted skies, and while I could have
<br>brought out a bit more of the tail, it would be at the expense of
<br>added noise.
<br>
<br>I shot 1x bin, 1 minute unguided, and tracked on the comets head. I
<br>then stacked them, and yes, removed the tracked stars and replaced
<br>them with a single one minute image taken from the last set.
<br>
<br>I was trying a straight RGB, and there was just not enough data, so
<br>I just made a luminence from the combined RGB, and then added the
<br>RGB to it. Next time I'll just do a straight 1x L and should get a
<br>bit more of the comet's tail.

Dennis and all
<br>The shots are magnificent. The whisp tail is very nice as well.
<br>Machholz is a welcome surprise after the little disappointment regarding T7
<br>and Q4 that did not rise to expectations.
<br>I am still trying to make the comet stand out more with the tail and not make

<br>Hi Waldemar,
<br>
<br>The tail detail is quite good in your images. I think your town

<br>
<br>Keep up the good work with the DSLRs  they are catching up to CCD

<br>Waldemar,
<br>Your images are about as good as any I have seen. I do have a couple
<br>of suggestions. Try posting a direct link in your post, instaed of
<br>making viewers click through your web pages. Your image does not
<br>show any signs of light pollution. The only thing that I can see
<br>that would improve them, would be longer exposure or a higher QE

<br>Hello All,
<br>I am an avid comet observer, and although most of my observations are
<br>visual, I just received the Meade Deep Sky Imager and coupled with my
<br>5" f/5 homenuilt refractor I hope do begin imaging all of my visually
<br>observed comets. I am creating an album on this site to showcase my
<br>work, however I am new to CCD imaging and could use any suggestions
<br>on improving my efforts that this group may have. My first image is
<br>of C/2004 Q2 Machholz taken on 12/17/04 at 23:00 EST. You can find it
<br>posted in the Photos - file - MSDeprest. The only processing I have
<br>done to the image is to convert it to grayscale. It is a composite of
<br>10 - 4sec exposures autostacked with the supplied software from the
<br>Meade DSI. All constructive comments are welcome.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>just a reminder that on Christmas night Comet LINEAR (C/2003 K4) will be very close (within half a degree) from NGC 2516 (the 'Running Man' cluster) in Carina.
<br>
<br>I imaged the comet in this field last night and added where the comet will lay in the next two nights. Also attached is a wider field showing the comet and the False Cross...
<br>
<br>Currently the comet is fading and is about mag 7 - 8ish.

<br>> Is the black dot in the middle the actual nucleus?
<br>> Dr. Eric Flescher ( kcstarguy@aol.com),
<br>
<br>Hello, thanks for your mail. The answer is no: normally any cometary nucleus is too small to be resolved by ground base instrumentation. For a few istances, there is some evidence (suspects?) of nucleus resolution using the HST.
<br>The black dot in my image is due to an artefact of the algorithm I used to evidence any deviation from the theoretical 1/r model: its presence means that for the regions much close to the nucleus, the 1/r model doesn't work.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

Subject:  Three Galaxies and a comet - M65, M66, NGC 3628, plus Comet 62P-Tsuchinshan
</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Comet 62P-Tsuchinshan passed just to the south of
<br>three bright galaxies in Leo the morning of December
<br>15, 2004. I caught all four objects in the same field
<br>of view of this image:
<br>
<br>http://www.quantumhyperspace.com/imagefiles/M65-M66-NGC3628-62PTsuchinshan-12152004-1118UT.JPG
<br>
<br>or
<br>
<br>http://makeashorterlink.com/?H2484291A
<br>
<br>In the composite image, comet 62P-Tsuchinshan is in
<br>the lower left. Included is the cropped region around
<br>the comet aligned on the comet body which showed its
<br>movement over a thirty minute period. M65 is near
<br>center, M66 above center, and NGC3628 in upper right.
<br>North is to the right and east up due to the piggy
<br>back arrnagement.
<br>
<br>These were combined from thirty 60 second frames taken
<br>with SBIG ST-2000 XCM + MiniBorg-60 (A=60 mm, FL=325
<br>mm FR=f/5.4)
<br>
<br>The field of view FOV is approximately 124 arc min x
<br>93.35 arc min.
<br>
<br>When I first combined the images with CCDSoft, a
<br>fourth fuzzy region was noted which I first thought
<br>was another galaxy. The next day, curiosity led me to
<br>discover that the fuzzy region did not correspond to
<br>anything that was supposed to be there when comparing
<br>the image with DSS images of the region. I thought I
<br>may have happened upon a new comet, but that was not
<br>to be. After going through the list of observable
<br>comets and comet charts from Reinder J. Bouma and
<br>Edwin van Dijk comet website
<br>(http://www.shopplaza.nl/astro/) (and thank you
<br>again), the fuzzy object turned out to be comet
<br>62P-Tsuchinshan. I was happy that I finally resolved
<br>what I had observed, but reluctantly dissappointed
<br>that I had not made a discovery. It was a big exciting
<br>discovery for me though!
<br>
<br>I may be a total neophyte green horn, but I have a
<br>functional CCD camera/fast telescope combination for
<br>hunting comets.
<br>
<br>This is my Christmas present from the big guy up there
<br>who made all this stuff. I am very happy about it.
<br>
<br>Merry Christmas to all of you. Best wishes for the
<br>holidays and the coming new year.

Inside the circle, its a blur because it has moved
<br>over thirty minutes. Inside the little box, you see
<br>the little dot that did NOT move while everything else
<br>did (and trailed). That's the comet.
<br>
<br>This was just a cropped portion of a stack of images
<br>aligned on the comet centroid.
<br>
<br>If you have a ccd camera, just stack a bunch of images
<br>covering the area of sky where a comet is, and then
<br>align and stack, you can find the comet as either the
<br>blur or the end of any line of dots.
<br>
<br>I think a reasonable CCD camera exposed for 60 seconds
<br>will show a trace of a magnitude 15 to 16 comet. I am
<br>guessing that two minutes per shot will may reach mag
<br>18. (I am not completely sure about these numbers, but
<br>I think they are in the ballpark.)
<br>
<br>This way you can see a comet electronically, when you
<br>can't see it in an eyepiece.
<br>
<br>Detective work!!
<br>
<br>I have some more images of the comet area that are
<br>stacked and aligned on the comet head:
<br>
<br>http://www.quantumhyperspace.com/62P/AlignedOnCometHead.JPG
<br>
<br>All thirty images are in the web folder at:
<br>http://www.quantumhyperspace.com/62P/12152004/
<br>
<br>I put up an image player web page at:
<br>http://www.quantumhyperspace.com/62P/62P-12152004.html
<br>
<br>You can see what I was seeing on all those 30 jpg
<br>files. The little blur distinctly moves in each frame.
<br>I named the frames with the exact time to the second
<br>of each image.

<br>
<br>hmmm, jugding from stars and galaxy NGC 1507 visible on your images I would guess, that there are two ion tails in main tail direction and relatively diffuse and wide sunward feature (should that be called antitail??)

Hi,
<br>Here's a wide field shot showing the anti-tail which is still rather
<br>broad and bright. It's not the best image because the optics didn't have
<br>a chance to cool down properly, but since clouds were moving in I
<br>decided to take some images anyway. This is a composite 16 min exposure,
<br>approx. 2.5 x 2.5 degrees, with N at right and full-moon only 40 degrees
<br>away.

Technically or otherwise speaking, what you have photographed is indeed categorized as an "anti-tail."  That was a beautiful and very useful image, Mike.

<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">

<br>>From JPL.
<br>
<br>Comet Definitions
<br>
<br>The following are generally accepted definitions for terms related
<br>to cometary astronomy.
<br>
<br>anti-tail or anomalous tail
<br>
<br>When a comet's tail appears to be pointing toward the Sun, this is
<br>called an anti-tail or anomalous tail. In reality, the tail only
<br>appears to be pointing toward the Sun. To get an anti-tail, the
<br>comet must produce large ("heavy") dust particles. If this happens,
<br>these particles are left along the comet's orbit instead of being
<br>pushed away from the Sun and the comet's orbit by light pressure.
<br>Often dusty comets will produce particules of different sizes
<br>creating a fan-shaped appearance. The smallest dust will be pushed
<br>directly away from the Sun (like the gas tail) and the largest will
<br>be left in the comet's orbit. When a comet is close to the Sun, the
<br>angle of this fan can be 90 degrees or larger. If the Earth-comet-
<br>Sun geometry is correct, the dust in the comet's orbit will appear
<br>to point toward the Sun. [Try this...make a right (90 degree) angle
<br>with your thumb and index finger. Your index finger is the main tail
<br>and your thumb is the dust left in the comet's orbit. Point your
<br>finger and thumb directly away from you (keeping the angle 90
<br>degrees). Your finger seems to be going in exactly the opposite
<br>direct from the thumb. This is what causes an anti-tail.]

Hi Mike, for me,
<br>You have photographed an anti-tail of dust, an anti-tail that had been
<br>foreseen also already in other mail of some days ago.
<br>
<br>If you are able, it is better to direct always your good images with the North aloft, and
<br>East to the left, so one is able more easily to check the image with the own sw.
<br>
<br>Best Regards

<br>Hi Terry,
<br>You've captured a nice long tail. I'm constantly amazed by how sensitive
<br>the 300D is!  Well processed too.
<br>
<br>Coincidentally, I imaged the comet at exactly the same time last night,
<br>but at a longer focal length (200mm).
<br>See http://www.tip.net.au/~vello/2004q2/20041228.jpg for the inner coma
<br>detail. The gaps in the star trials are from excluding images that
<br>contained satellite trails (15 of the 29 original 60 sec images were
<br>discarded!)
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Vello

<br>Thanks Vello,

<br>I am pretty impressed by the 300D especially the wide field compared
