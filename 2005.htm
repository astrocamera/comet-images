<br>One of the nicest photos I have seen of the comet shows the following
<br>
<br>"In photographs, Comet Machholz (C/2004 Q2) has been showing a blue gas tail
<br>and the edge of an orange-yellowish dust tail emerging at very different
<br>angles from the coma. Johannes Schedler in Austria took this picture on December
<br>12, 2004, using a Canon EF 200mm f/2.8 lens on an SBIG STL-11000M CCD
<br>camera. Courtesy Johannes Schedler."
<br>
<br>If you have comet photos, illustrations, ccd pics or combination, you

<br>Hi Terry,
<br>You've captured a nice long tail. I'm constantly amazed by how sensitive
<br>the 300D is!  Well processed too.
<br>
<br>Coincidentally, I imaged the comet at exactly the same time last night,
<br>but at a longer focal length (200mm).
<br>See http://www.tip.net.au/~vello/2004q2/20041228.jpg for the inner coma
<br>detail. The gaps in the star trials are from excluding images that
<br>contained satellite trails (15 of the 29 original 60 sec images were
<br>discarded!)
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Vello

Hello,
<br>this is an image of C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) I obtained a couple of nights ago with some narrowband filters. Each  original frame was treated with an azimuthally-normalized alghorythm, in order to enhance some details within the coma. It seems that in the CN there was a couple of jets, not visible in the C2 or dust continuum.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni Sostero (Remanzacco Observatory, Italy)

<br>Rick.  I am sure it would.  It is a fine line to walk with an image
<br>like this one which only has 60 seconds each of RGBL.  Add in the

<br>Mike,
<br>I fully understand the difficulity of getting the best image of this
<br>comet and agree with your comments. My only attempt is at the link
<br>below. Click on 2nd image down.
<br>http://home.earthlink.net/~rickwiggins/index.html
<br>I used a STL11k camera on FSQ with single LRGB 210sec exposures,
<br>binned 3x3. The STL11k is a low QE camera. I was fighting between
<br>showing detail in the tail and noise. The comet is now moving faster,
<br>so I would not be able to capture in color using this method with
<br>this camera. I was hoping for another attemp this month, but weather
<br>has stopped all dry efforts here. Here is a link to a cool method of
<br>comet capture and processing:
<br>http://www.ewellobservatory.com/ccd/comet.cfm
<br>It probably doesn't match your exact equipment, but contains many
<br>good ideas.
<br>I also did a side by side comparison of your 2 images on my LCD
<br>monitor in photoshop. Visually (and on my monitor), I liked the
<br>smoothed version a little better. It looks as if you were able to
<br>hold all the detail, but still remove some noise.
<br>Excellent work!

<br>Very nice Burkhard,

<br>Michael and Gerald,
<br>Another beauty. Great image and what a keeper! I hope you guys will
<br>document your techniques soem day. I think you have a great
<br>methodology. See Richard Bennion's monograph of his procedures:
<br>http://www.ewellobservatory.com/ccd/comet.cfm
<br>I did get to look at it with the binoculars last night as clouds
<br>drifted by. Our visibility is now down to around 500 feet (I can
<br>barely see the freeway below my office on the 10th floor). I had
<br>planned to visit dark skies to have a go at the comet, but the dark
<br>skies are only accessable via snowmobile and clouds expected for at
<br>least another week. So keep the images coming, that we may follow
<br>your progress.

Hi Gerald and Michael

<br>A middle latitude auroral watch was issued late yesterday, in which it states: "A strong southward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field is in-progress."  It will be interesting to see further developments on the ion tail.  I got this "snap-off" visually last night. Sketch to follow asap.

<br>Michael & Gerald.  I can't stop looking at that simply amazing
<br>image.  If I use a little iminagination it almost appears the comet
<br>has a tail disconnect but has also spit out a star cluster.  Rolando

Hi Michael and Gerald,
<br>
<br>They are huge sacrifices that understand, but the result is superlative!
<br>
<br>A question :
<br>
<br>How do you do to put the ccd inside the telescope, but above all, as do you do to put to
<br>fire? How do you do to use the filters?
<br>
<br>Also I use the SXVH9 with the photographic objectives,
<br>
<br>but don't I succeed in using with the sleigh for the filters, you as you do?
<br>

Hi list,
<br>
<br>while planning morning observing sessions for C/2003 T4 (LINEAR) for the weekend
<br>(I really hope I manage myself out of the bed...) I noticed that the comet will be
<br>in the same field with M57, the ring nebula in Lyra. It is not listed in Seiichi's
<br>comet rendezvous list because the distance is not that close. For those with wide
<br>angle imaging capabilities it might be a nice shot to have the 11mag comet and the
<br>nebula in the same field.
<br>
<br>It will be at its closest to M57 on Jan. 16 with about 1 deg. By the way, on
<br>February 12 it will pass M27 at about 3 deg and on February 15 it will pass M71
<br>with about 1 deg.
<br>
<br>I really hope my bed releases me (besides the co-operation of the weather). ;)
<br>

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>yes 'Coops' (Ian Cooper) is a living legend here in New Zealand (besides
<br>variable star/comet discoverer/1987A visual discoverer Albert Jones). Ian
<br>knows so much about everything astronomical (and can relate to all ages in a
<br>non arrogant way). One astronomer wrote this about Coops at Stardate...
<br>
<br>Once again I marvel at Ian's expertise. i.e. I have recently installed a set
<br>of Rudy Zondag's Palm DSC ( recommended ) on my 16". At one point on
<br>Saturday night the cable was accidentally unplugged. I didn't need to plug
<br>it back in and do a realignment until Ian moved off to another 'scope.
<br>
<br>And so he should know the sky, he's written much (if not all) of the 'Night
<br>Sky Observing Guide' for the Southern Hemisphere (volume 3) - soon to be
<br>released.
<br>
<br>If any society was rich enough, Ian would be a great speaker to sponsor to
<br>come and speak.
<br>
<br>Sorry if this is off-topic...

<br>Hello,
<br>
<br>at first many thanks for your replys to our images.
<br>
<br>Now I spend a couple of hours to make an animation of Q2/M45 pass and
<br>tail disconnect. The video covers 4:27 hours from 17:51 to 22:18 UT
<br>It was really complicated because i don't have the video skills.
<br>
<br>You find it under http://www.schweifstern.de/ klick on the link in
<br>the upper right corner.
<br>
<br>Download the mpg-file and watch it best in media player several times!
<br>Watch out for the disconnect section and also for the tail clouds
<br>passing over M45.
<br>
<br>BE AWARE!!! The file has nearly 5 MB!!!

<br>I imaged Q2 Machholz and have a movie showing its motion across the

<br>
<br>In my "simulated eyepiece view", a/k/a "digital sketch", I show a
<br>faint greenish cast to the comet head.  I viewed the comet with the
<br>NP101 with eyepieces varying in focal length from 6.4 mm to 30 mm.
<br>The 9 mm Nagler gave the best view for me under the moonlit sky.
<br>
<br>It sure seemed to me that I saw a faint green color. Was I just
<br>imagining it, or have other visual observers seen some color lately?
<br>
<br>I have included a Larson-Sekanina filter view of the comet head.
<br>This is a very powerful filter to bring out jets.  I'd appreciate
<br>feedback as to whether I've applied it properly.  It certainly has
<br>the potential to bring out artifacts if improperly applied.

<br>Waldemar,
<br>Nice image. Care to trade skies. Ours is around Mag2 to Mag2.5 in the

Hi to everybody,
<br>
<br>On last January 17 I have photographed the comet with mine apo 114/600,
<br>
<br>ccd SXVH9 in bin 2x2, every minute from 19:36TU to 20:11 TU.
<br>
<br>At 19:39 o'clock I have begun to take back a strange phenomenon that you can see to this
<br>address: http://comete.uai.it/comete/variazioni.jpg
<br>
<br>I premise that the ccd was power on from over a time and that the objective of the
<br>telescope had not misted. What can that be from me photographed?
<br>
<br>Is there someone who has some images done around the time of my photo?
<br>
<br>Thanks.

<br>Wanted to see if the recent solar activity has affected the tail in

<br>although the Moon was close I have imaged in much brighter

<br>Hi Rolando,
<br>
<br>I have *exactly* the same effect visible in my movie!  See
<br>http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>
<br>My mentor explained that it is due to frost forming on the MX716
<br>cover glass. Unfortunately, it is quite likely do to water vapor
<br>inside the chip cavity.  The quick fix (for my MX716) is a blast
<br>from a hair dryer; the long-term fix is to put the camera in a
<br>bottle with a fresh desiccant and let it sit for several days.  The
<br>water will eventually come out by the process of diffusion.

<br>  I would point out only my experience with the SBIG camera!!.  The

<br>A dust mote would be there from the start to a certain extent, so I

<br>starting point which seems to grow as the frost grows on the chip or
<br>covering .  Frost distorts, and yet this image or images, of the

<br>right side. and then receeds after in the next frames.  So what would
<br>cause the area of the dust tail to clear up and leave the stars

<br>After thinking about this for a bit, my brain has come up with a
<br>small possible solution.  All of the images are uniform in the start
<br>and after the area appears.  All flat are are applied and nothing has
<br>been done differently to cause this area.
<br>  The flat area in image 14:53 has kept me going back to look.  If a
<br>brief but undectected area of light appeared from one side, would
<br>this not cause such a centered area to be detected in only a few of
<br>the images?  Growing from one side as the light grew in strength and
<br>then receding as it passed?   This would also account for the flat
<br>side to the area.  It could be almost undecteable, except, by the ccd
<br>chip and would show up as a flaw in the finished image.  Images
<br>except for the ones that had the extra light input would look ok.
<br>Other than the comet clearing an area itself in the dust tail, this
<br>is all I can say which might be one solution.  Mike H.

<br>
<br>Hi Mike,
<br>excluding the problem frozen, I think that the phenomenon from me photographed both tied
<br>up to a reflex of the Moon, rather far from the comet in the moment of the photo, but
<br>considering the sensibility of the ccds, everything is possible...
<br>Little times have made photo to the comets with the present Moon, next time that I will do
<br>it, I will equip me with a longer lens screen, so that to avoid the problem!

Hi Alex
<br>
<br>Hmmmm... excellent images with this veteran camera!  I too have a MTL3 in pristine condition, I collect old cameras.  Did you know that this camera is apparently quite valuable as a collector's item?  I also have two original Nikon F's  (not a scratch on them) with about nine Nikkormat lenses...these are apparently worth a fortune and this camera has it's own dedicated website!  The shots that I get from these, as I am also a professional terrestrial  photographer are stunning...no digital camera that has less than 6 megapixels can compare, I have found.  As far as I know, (and the group can correct me if I am wrong)Nikon F's were used on the Gemini missions and, together with Leica and Hasselblad, also on the Apollo missions.  These cameras of mine have seen a lot of comets, from Kohoutek in '73 up until Machholz in 2005!  It's great to be able to image with cameras that require no batteries, and so much less expensive!!!  Here, two batteries for my Canon EOS 2000 Rebel cost Z$600,000.00!!!  That's a weeks' groceries for two people in this country.   Welcome to the group.

<br>Hello Michael,
<br>yes, comet Machholz inner coma seems to be pretty active! I have
<br>imaged this structures on several nights using narrowband filters,
<br>and it seems that the feature is mainly produced by dust, possibly
<br>dragged off by gas emissions emanating from the active areas on the
<br>nucleus. I will post later the link to a recent image, where this
<br>stuff is evidenced by means of several image processing procedures.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni Sostero (Remanzacco Obs, CARA)

<br>Added a single 74x56 arc-min frame image.  Used a new program to

<br>Rolando.  Yes the comet is easly showing 2' of tail.  The 3xmosaic is
<br>showing 3' of comet including the coma and I had another frame which
<br>could have been added to show another 1' of tail, but clouds made it

<br>I recently bought  2 Canon Digital Rebels (6M pixel), with 24mm/1.4L,
<br>50mm/1.4, 200mm/2.8L, 15mm/2.8, 100mm/2.8 (macro), 1.4x TC.  (along with
<br>Manual Focus 50mm/1.2L, 85mm/1.2L).  Also, have adapters to use Nikon
<br>300mm/2.8, 180mm/2.8 (& my other Nikon lenses down to 16mm/2.8 fisheye)
<br>with an ST2000 (same camera Mike has) using Mandel WFA.  I have an
<br>Astrophysics Traveler (4.1" f6..610mm focal-length, plus .75 TC).  This
<br>along with my film cameras: Pentax 6x7, 8" f1.5 Schmidt Camera (TP2415 &
<br>E100G).
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, I'm extremely distracted with work...missed a number of
<br>clear days.  It has been clear (but very windy) since Sat.  So, I missed
<br>the above! (very disapppointing, since my reputation is getting comets
<br>on clear days here in Mojave desert..see
<br>http://www.comet-track.com/hb/hb.html ).  I think I can get out tonight
<br>for a "quickie"..just film with 8" Schmidt Camera (TP2415 & color).  Can
<br>do the one-shot color with Canon D300 & lens assortment.  I wish Mike
<br>could handle my ST2000..still has never took an astrophoto!! (had this
<br>camera for 2 years now).
<br>
<br>Hey Mike, if I send you my equipment (ST2000 with CFW, Mandel WFA, Nikon
<br>300mm/2.8, 180mm/2.8, 105mm/2.5, 50mm/1.4, Robofocus)..can you handle
<br>the workload?  I have my hands full with work, not to mention driving
<br>out 120+ miles (3hr drive minimum..ONE WAY) do run 2 systems: film (8"
<br>Schmidt camera) PLUS Canon D300 (2 bodies with lens assortment).
<br>Probably, not physically possible, since that's at least 6 hrs of
<br>driving.  Wait, I can actually goto another site..only 90 min drive
<br>one-way.  That's more feasible.  STILL, I'm burdened with work
<br>
<br>[ see http://www.jumplive.com , click on "real time webcast
<br>Laughlin"..when I was out in Arizona on Jan 18/19 for this OffRoadRace,
<br>I got one night of shooting..wide field of comet ]
<br>
<br>Ever since then, it's been moonlight or rain..but it cleared up this
<br>last Saturday (VERY windy & cold).  Missed Sunday, which is maddening.
<br>Probably will go out tonight, despite some work committments.
<br>
<br>I REALLY need someone to use my ST2000+CFW (Nikon 300mm/2.8 &
<br>Astrophysics 610mm f6 + .75 TC) in southern California..or someone like
<br>Mike elsewhere, who has a *strong* committment like myself.  Any ideas?
<br>Yeah, I could ship the equipment out to a deserving comet
<br>astrophotographer.  I think I just answered my question while
<br>typing..Martin Germano.  He's been chomping to get into CCD, so here's a
<br>perfect opportunity.  Then, I can concentrate on work commitments.
<br>
<br>What is the situation with the Comet?  Is it still strengthening, or did
<br>it already peak in mid January.  I got a visual magnitude report of 4.5,
<br>so it's still pretty decent.

Hello Charles,
<br>    That was an exciting night, and I was experimenting  at the time I took
<br>the images.
<br>I set up my 35 MM Minolta XE 7 with 400 speed color film, on a  tripod with a
<br>wide angle 28 mm lens, and an extended shutter button. After  pointing I
<br>would manually hold the shutter open for from 30 seconds to 2 minutes  per
<br>exposure. After I had my pictures developed I scanned the color negatives at  1200
<br>dots/inch. My scanner is a Cannon 5000 F, and you can scan color negatives,  and
<br>print out color prints. I then loaded the bitmap files into image composer
<br>and enlarged, and cropped out the better meteors I had captured. Some
<br>negatives had up to 4 meteors on them. It was an experiment, but it worked  great, the
<br>color is real too. There were times during that storm you could count  3
<br>mentors at the same instant, that helped a lot.The pictures on the web site  are
<br>from 40 exposures, This was a lot of fun, I wished I had had 4 cameras  going
<br>at the same time, I missed some great ones.
<br>Hope this helps.
<br>Best Regards, Steve Cox

<br>Hey Dennis.  Without getting exact, I would say that 3 deg. of comet
<br>are showing in this mosaic.  N is up and it was take at about 0230UT
<br>02/10/2005.  You can compare a program to get exact but I think this
<br>is close.  Tail is at this time fading and will retract with time

<br>Well, finally got to a point that I was satisified with.  It is a

<br>Took 24 hours of on/off work to remove gradients and try to smooth
<br>out the noise.  Ended up with one piece of space trash in one frame
<br>but as they say, it gives character, I guess.  It is reduced 50% from

<br>C/2005 A1 (LINEAR) 2005 February 12.50 UT: m1 = 10.3, Dia.= 2'.0, DC = 4,  41cm f4.5 Reflect (83x). John Drummond, (Gisborne, New Zealand)  [A1 appears as a small smudge of haze. It's somewhat brighter than a few weeks ago. Has a small coma with some slight central condensation - has a larger haze around it? No tail visually - but clearly seen photographically. Rapid movement. 33* alt in the SE. Stellar LM =15.5 (scope)].

<br>Hello all.
<br>
<br>I've decided to sell my Celestron 8-inch f/1.5 Schmidt Camera (with
<br>Epoch upgrade). I may put it on eBay but wanted to give first choice
<br>to anyone on the list who might be interested. Even though I bought
<br>this new from Celestron more than ten years ago it has been used on
<br>less than ten separate occasions. I'd like to get $3,000 for it.
<br>
<br>It is fitted with Losmandy dovetails.

<br>The above mentioned image was obtained under poor conditions (bright moonlight); however the comet is showing a well developed coma and a nice tail. Total magnitude through a Cousins R filter is close to 13.9; the tail is almost 1.2' long toward West.

<br>
<br>Hello Dennis,
<br>the answer depends on a number of variables (like the chip and the reference stars you used, the aperture adopted to perform the photometry, and so on...). However on Mar. 6.07 I measured 9P/Tempel at R=13.6 with a coma of almost 1.1 arcmin; a magnitude of 12.5 sounds a little too much on the brighter side (discarding the outburst hypothesis).
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

<br>Hi Giovanni,
<br>
<br>My 12.5 came from my planetarium program, SkyMap Pro, and Seiichi's
<br>site. However, as I look at recent observations, I see a spread from
<br>magnitude 13.0 to 14.0.  Perhaps that explains why I had such a
<br>noisy image! I guess the comet is dimmer than I thought.

<br>
<br>Thanks. Currently its CCD magnitude in R is almost 13.0, while in V it's 13.2 (coma of almost 1' diameter). Visual estimations place it a little brighter (as usual) around 12.5.

Hello Dennis,
<br>I imaged 62P/Tsuchinshan on March 13.99, 2005 through a 10" SC+ CCD+Cousins R filter, measuring a total magnitude close to R=13.2. There is a distinct central condensation, surrounded by a faint  coma of almost 2 arcmin in diameter.
<br>I will post a link to the image.

<br>Hello Giovanni,
<br>
<br>Your set of images is very good.  What software do you use for the
<br>false color image? I think it shows the tail structure even better
<br>than the negative.

<br>
<br>Thanks Dennis! I normally use the "rainbow" false colors palette option of Astroart 3. As you know, the details visibility for such faint comae is strictly depending on the stretching of the image, so frequently I have to play a little with the levels (and the logarithmic strecth) to obtain a satisfactory results.

<br>A brief note from your moderators --
<br>
<br>We've been spoiled over the past year with a number of bright comets,

<br>Greg Crinklaw's list of currently visible comets are a great starting

<br>Greeting to the board.   The rain has not let up for weeks.  I have
<br>resorted to going back through older information in search of something
<br>missed.  5 days before Machholz passed M45 I found almost 100mb of data
<br>I never processed.  At the time this comet was moving so quickly that
<br>mosaics were hard to compose.  The bright head of the comet also gives
<br>problems with the fainter parts of the tail when it is in the same
<br>frame.  What I have done is not use the head and pieced to gether 25
<br>minutes of information from 25x60 second images.  Difficult because of
<br>gradients caused by the comet along with movement.  This does show what
<br>I think is a nice tail mosaic with more detail than I have managed
<br>before.  Negative image also helps.  It was a turbulant time for a
<br>comets tail in this one.  File is 550kb if you have dial up like me it
<br>will take a minute to load.    Thanks, Mike H.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>have just been looking at what the 'brighter' comets are doing in April and I see that Comet 2003 T4 (LINEAR) will be covered by the Moon for about 45 minutes (according to GUIDE 8 from NZ) on Tuesday 5th April 2005 (from about 9:09 to 9:53 UT). Sadly for me in New Zealand it will be set, but there must be someone on this round planet who might see and image it. T4 may be about mag 6 and the Moon will be a thin crescent of 26 days old.

<br>
<br>Hi all!
<br>
<br>We used the good weather in the last days to adjust another 8" Schmidt for CCD and to take some pictures from different comets.
<br>
<br>comet 9P/Tempel 1, will be the target for the "Deep Impact" Mission in July and showes an inner and outer coma with a broad dust tail.
<br>
<br>Furhter we captured  62P/Tsuchinshan and 141P/Machholz!
<br>
<br>You can find this pictures under:
<br>
<br>http://www.astrostudio.at/Astrofotos/astrofotos.php?kategorie=Deep-Sky    click for comets and select
<br>
<br>Also we took pictures of 2004/Q2 on April 1. 2. and 3.On April  2. the comet showed a disconnection event, which we were able to expose in color:

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">

<br>On July 4, the NASA Deep Impact probe will crash into periodic comet
<br>9P/Tempel 1. Hopefully the impact will cause a dramatic increase in
<br>brightness.  Meanwhile, I have been imaging 9P as it slowly wends
<br>its way through Virgo. Images and accompanying data at
<br>http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>
<br>Last night afforded a unique imaging opportunity: There were no
<br>stars brighter than magnitude 15 within 3 arc minutes of 9P.  That
<br>allowed me to guide on the comet head and obtain a relatively high
<br>statistics image of the comet structure uncluttered by star trails.
<br>My previous comet guiding attempts were foiled when the comet would
<br>pass over a star. My VLM was only 2.5 but long integration time
<br>eventually wins out over light pollution.
<br>
<br>The image comprises 8 x 10 minutes with the E160 and SXV-H9 camera.
<br>I have added isophote and color intensity contours and some
<br>additional supporting data to my New Images page.
<br>
<br>My sincere thanks to Jeff Terry for loan of the H9 camera and to
<br>Giovanni Sostero (Remanzacco Observatory, Italy) for the method of
<br>employing the Rainbow Palette in AstroArt 3 to bring out structure.
<br>
<br>Thank you for visiting my site.

<br>Very Nice collection, thanks for sharing.
<br>Looking through your site - now that I have fast BB (for Oz) at last it
<br>is a joy to surf  :-)
<br>I visited your Comet Ikeya Zhang page - I had no idea Izzy was that
<br>good!!!  I mostly saw just stunning closer-ups from that apparition - I
<br>dont ever recall seeing widefields quite like that!!?? Also love the
<br>Bradfield and bright meteor - its hard enough to get just a nice bright
<br>meteor - let alone a nice comet and one!! I do remember that one from

<br>Yeah, I got very lucky both with Comet Machholz and Comet Ikeya-

<br>they were very transparent nights. Here's how I rank the comets since

<br>
<br>Hello Dennis,
<br>thanks for your reply. Actually I'm not sure yet if this detail is real
<br>or not: some fellow Italian amateurs haven't registered it in their
<br>shots. So I was asking for some other's images. However there is a
<br>frame of F. J. Melillo obtained on April 10, posted on the "Deep-
<br>Impact" webpage, where this thin and straight tail is readily visible.
<br>
<br>I was wondering if the evidence of this feature is increased when the
<br>exposure time is low (average of multiple 30sec shots, like in my frame
<br>and that of Melillo). I'm really puzzled about this thing: it could be
<br>as well an artifact of some kind, or a a detail that need the
<br>appropiate combination of contrast to be evidenced.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni Sostero (Remanzacco Observatory, Italy)

<br>Hi Giovanni,
<br>
<br>Last night I tried 6 x 4 minutes guided on the head,  binned 2x2 at
<br>f/3.3, but got only a short, fan-shaped tail looking like my image
<br>of a week ago.  VLM 3.5 and transparency good.  I was disappointed.

<br>the  exposure time is low (average of multiple 30sec shots, like in
<br>my frame  and that of Melillo). I'm really puzzled about this thing:
<br>it could be  as well an artifact of some kind, or a a detail that
<br>need the  appropiate combination of contrast to be evidenced.

<br>
<br>Hello Dennis,
<br>thanks for your effort. In the meantime, some analysis were conduceted within the CARA team members. On some archive images secured during the last couple of weeks (in particular those obtained through B and V photometric filters) this appendage becames sometimes visible. It also seems to be aligned in the projected direction of the "theoretical" ion tail. So there is a possibility that this feature is real (the gas-tail component). It's a kind of mistery why sometimes it becames visible and others not, but if it's true, it's likely a detail very close to the noise level, and the use of filters could be helpful to discriminate it. In the next weeks we will make deeper filtered shots, in order to verify this hypothesis.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni Sostero (Remanzacco Observatory, CARA)

<br>Thanks Dennis! The comet is also brightening: last night I measured a total magnitude of almost 11.5, with a coma diameter of 3'. The tail is wide and fan shaped, extending almost 2' toward south-west.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>Comet 2003 T4 (LINEAR) is looking nice at the moment. It's in the morning sky (rising about 2.30am local time - from NZ) and has a nice photographic tail (at least 2 degrees long). It's definitely worth getting up and having a look / taking an image.
<br>
<br>The following are two images I took this morning - the first through my 16" f4.5 Meade Newtonian and the other through a 70-200mm Sigma lens with a 1.4x telextender (200 x 1.4 x 1.6 = 448mm @ f4).

Hi all,
<br>
<br>John Burt and I went out to a local beach here in New Zealand at about 3am this morning (Wed 20 April) to image comet 2003 T4 (LINEAR). We had a few problems - the results of which will probably be shown at the astrophotography camp (in a few weeks time) on 'what not to do' but we did get one so-so image (poorly focused though). Regardless, a tail can be seen extending for nearly 4 degrees, so we are happy...

<br>
<br>Hello John,
<br>nice image: congratulations! I noticed that, apart the long ion tail in PA225 degrees, it seems that you captured also a short (~20') tail in PA 295 deg. Could it be the dust tail?
<br>Anyway, this pretty  picture reminds me the double tail feature shown recently by comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz).
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni
<br>
<br>P.S. just for the record, it seems to me that the proper UT time for your shot should be Apr. 19.72.

Hi Michael,
<br>
<br>nice images. Great to see that you keep ongoing photographic records of
<br>these visitors.
<br>
<br>Your C/2003 T4 image from April 8.79 supports my suspicion that the long ion
<br>tail is imbedded in a very broad dust tail with a width angle of about 80
<br>degrees. Giovanni raised this issue in a recent email that the 'long ion
<br>tail in PA225 degrees, seems also [to have] a short (~20') tail in PA 295

<br>
<br>Hello Dennis,
<br>this filter has been selected by the CARA collaboration because it is centered in a region of the cometary spectra without noticeable emission lines. Thus it is good if you are interested on the solar continuum scattered by the dust particles within the cometary coma/tail.
<br>
<br>You can find more informations about this technique on the CARA webpage (http://cara.uai.it).
<br>I ordered my filter from Edmund Optics:
<br>http://www.edmundoptics.com/onlinecatalog/DisplayProduct.cfm?productid=1903
<br>
<br>Hope this will help.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

<br>Hi Giovanni,
<br>
<br>Wow! The CARA site has all kinds of good stuff on comets.  Thanks
<br>for the link. The site is recommended reading for all comet imagers.
<br>
<br>Looking at the specs for the filter, it seems to attenuate a lot of
<br>signal. May I correctly assume that is not a magic light pollution
<br>filter that will enhance the contrast of the tail?

<br>
<br>Well, it surely helps cutting a lot of emission lines due to the light pollution, however as you correctly state, it also cut most of the incident light. This means that you have to take *huge* exposures for a target as faint as 9P/Tempel: in order to obtain some details, I exposed for a total of almost 1 hour with a 18" reflector. So, I'm afraid that for purely aesthetic purposes there are better solutions. A broadband R filter, is surely most suited: the dust tail of comet Tempel 1 is well visible with my Cousins R: this filter passes more signal, and cut some light pollution, as well.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

Many of you have read the articles in Sky and Telescope and

<br>experiment.  I imaged the comet on May 1st. Images and accompanying
<br>data at

<br>
<br>Tak E160 with SXV-H9 guided by NP101 with MX-716.
<br>
<br>The image comprises 3 x 3 minutes and 15 x 3 with the E160 and SXV-
<br>H9 camera, binned 2x2.  I have added isophote and color intensity
<br>contours and some additional supporting data to my New Images page.
<br>I was surprised that the additional 36 minutes, a factor of 4

On May 10th 9P was close to NGC 4779, providing a nice photo op.
<br>Images and accompanying data at
<br>http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>
<br>NOAA weather radio reported an "upper level disturbance" over the
<br>region.  It sure disturbed the seeing!  I had great difficulty
<br>focusing and guiding in what seemed to be Pickering 1 skies.  My
<br>image scale of 5 arc seconds per pixel (2x2 binning at 530 mm focal
<br>length) helped to mitigate the terrible seeing.

Q2 is a very good target sitting high in the north after dark.  The
<br>look is very nice with a brigh center.  9P is not changed much.  It
<br>could be my the hoping to see more as each night goes by, but it looks

<br>Excellent image!  It also confirms the spherical coma with offset central condensation that I have being  seeing visually the last few days...the extended tail is far less apparent than it was visually  or in images on around the 8th of May

Very nice shot. It looked like the picture in APOD- Astro pic of the day
<br>except that one was a little bluer. My shot is not as magnified but had a little

</pre>

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
With a full moon I decided to image a couple of comets. I started
<br>out with 9P Tempel 1 and then moved on to Q2 Machholz. Inspection of
<br>the subframes of Q2 during acquisition indicated a longer tail than
<br>I've imaged recently, bright moonlight notwithstanding. When I
<br>processed 80 minutes of 60 second subframes I was greeted with a 27
<br>arc minute tail.  This seems longer than I've seen in recent images
<br>of Q2.  I'd appreciate any inputs as to the significance of my
<br>seemingly longer tail observation.
<br>
<br>I believe I've correctly oriented the image with North up/East to
<br>left, but Guide 8 depicts the tail trailing to the Southeast.
<br>Comments?

<br>Image comprises 80 minutes of 60 second subframes.  Takahashi E-160

Hello Waldemar,
<br>your images looks really impressive, expecially if one consider that they were obtained with a telephoto lens! Comet C/2005 K2 (LINEAR) is very interesting, since it appears to be several magnitudes brighter than expected. In your shot it has a greenish hue, that is normally produced by gaseus comets; this seems to confirm some CCD photometric measurements I made yesterday night.

Hello Giovanni,
<br>the greenish hue is pretty easy visible on a single 3min raw shot.
<br>The images are made with a telephoto lens.... ok its a 400/2,8 fully open so
<br>there can some light go through.
<br>
<br>The biggest problems I had was the air temperature (noise in uncooled DSLR)
<br>and no astronomical darkness.
<br>

Comet movie (dial-up modem friendly) , images and supporting data at
<br>http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>
<br>I have included a modem-friendly movie (38 kb) GIF that shows K2
<br>streaking across 9.3 arc minutes of Ursa Major. That comet is really
<br>racing across the FOV!
<br>
<br>On my web page I have a color-intensity that illustrates the kind of
<br>artifacts that one can generate with our powerful processing
<br>software!  It looks like there are jets emanating from K2. However,
<br>the "jets" are in act nothing more than remnants from the median
<br>combine star trails that have been smoothed out.  I find that one
<br>has to be careful in digging out faint structure in comet images
<br>lest one create something that is really not there.
<br>
<br>At first I was unable to find K2 in my image using SkyMap Pro with
<br>two day old ephemeredes to get the coordinates.  Then I obtained
<br>fresh ephemeredes and the declination difference was 34 arc minutes
<br>between new and old!  The orbital parameters' accuracy must be
<br>improving daily!
<br>
<br>Please take a look at my images.
<br>
<br>Clear skies,

Greetings.  Two comets from last night the 9th.  Tried for 3 but 2005
<br>K2 just wouldn't show.  Tried the latest cordinates and still had no
<br>luck.  Wanted Q2 with M94 and must say M94 Sucks!  Would take much more
<br>info and processing to make this galaxy look ok.  This is 14 x40
<br>seconds for each object (q2 and M94).  Put into PS for processing.  9P
<br>was small but nice last night.  Image is 24x40 second stack on the

<br>page.  Thanks, Mike H.

9P has no change that I could see.  I have had better skys but lucky to
<br>gather any info at all with the changing weather.  C/2005 K2 is a small
<br>bright comet. Looked for 30 minutes before I found it.  Thought the

<br>didn't.  This image of K2 is 20x45 second exp.  Used the 4" FSQ and

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Dear list,
<br>
<br>this morning I received two images of C/2005 K2 taken by Michael Jaeger and Gerald
<br>Rhemann on June 12. These CCD images (I'll post these tonight) showed a strange
<br>additional condensation in direction of the short tail. However, it was not clear
<br>if this was a condensation in the tail or maybe a chipped off part of the comets
<br>nucleus. The feature occured in several images so it seemed not an artefact.
<br>
<br>Michael Jaeger now points out that David Strange has also imaged this feature,
<br>this time with larger focal length thus showing the feature more clearly.
<br>
<br>http://www.dstrange.freeserve.co.uk/2005K2_20050613_dgs.jpg
<br>
<br>It really seems that this comet has at least lost one larger part and this may be
<br>responsible for the observed brightness increase. Further close monitoring
<br>especially with larger focal lengths is strongly recommended!
<br>
<br>Cheers, Maik

Hello,
<br>this is our image obtained on Jun 13.16, 2005, where the secondary
<br>component of C/2005 K2 (LINEAR) is already clearly visible (we have it
<br>on sevarl nights of imaging). Later I will post other images and infos
<br>obtained on other nights.
<br>
<br>I sent to the CBAT the offset of this secondary condensation, as
<br>measured on our frames: there is a noticeable drift of this splitted
<br>part, against the main nucleus, along 24 hours. I suggest to all of you
<br>to perform astrometry over this component, and to provide this
<br>information to the CBAT.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni Sostero and Ernesto Guido (CARA)

<br>Astronomical Society.

<br>My main interest is imaging comets and I took this activity up in
<br>May 2004, so I'm quite new to it. I use a modest Televue 85
<br>telescope on a Losmandy GM-8 mount and I image with a Canon EOS 10D
<br>DSLR camera - not ideal - but its very mobile. One day I hope to do
<br>proper CCD imaging. I've imaged quite a few comets now including:
<br>
<br>9P Tempel 1, 78P Gehrels, C/2004 Q2, C/2004 Q1, C/2002 T7, C/2003
<br>T4, C/2003 K4 and C/2001 Q4

Hi Rolando,
<br>
<br>It looks like the split nucleus is still there!  Thanks for posting
<br>this.  I hope to image it tonight as I have not had good skies since
<br>the split occurred.

<br>With our instrumentation and with the current position of the comet, is the maximum one

I have reworked the information.  Cut the # of frames in 1/2 and
<br>cropped the images down.  It still is 1mb but to reduce it any further
<br>cuts the quality and there just wasn't much in each frame to start
<br>with.  Here is a direct link.  Covers 32 minuts of time with 24x40 sec

<br>people are members of so many forums and lists they spend most of the

Just added an image from 06/23.  It is a combination of 42 minutes of
<br>information.  The crazy line coming out of the top of the comet has got
<br>to be a figment of my cameras imagination.  It didn't want to go away

Hello.  The board was started for imagers to post links to comets or
<br>load into the storage (files/Photo).  It works with the Comet ml and
<br>comet obs. boards very well and keeps messages and images in places
<br>people can go without seeing post that are not what there looking
<br>for.    Seems to work pretty good.  It is also for anyone who has an
<br>image question or question about processing of a comet image.  Comes
<br>in handy for the current comets if you want to know what you are
<br>looking for in the field.  This board also has IMO the top imagers of
<br>comets there are.  It seemes sometimes not much is going on but the
<br>comet imagers are all hooked and will post again.  Cheers, Mike H.

Hello,
<br>according to our images, it seems that currently the secondary
<br>condensation of C/2005 K2 (LINEAR) -see IAUC Nr.8543- has been
<br>vanished: our CCD shots shows in a striking manner that during these
<br>last days, this feature became progressively fainter, broader and
<br>diffused. On the last couple of nights it was well below the threshold
<br>limit of our instrument (R magnitude almost 18-18.5).
<br>
<br>In the images, there is also the hint of a possible extension of the
<br>main object coma toward the secondary condensation (dust tail
<br>component? Possible third fragment? Train of debris? Noise?).
<br>
<br>It would be very interesting if anyone else would be able to follow up
<br>the evolution of this comet; unfortunately the observing conditions
<br>are really poor, however we will be happy to receive any  additional
<br>report about the phenomena.

Hi Will,
<br>If you can afford a professionally modified top of the line 20D, then
<br>that is the obvious best first choice in DSLR's (many electronic
<br>engineering talented people here have modified their own cameras).
<br>Depends what you want, pretty pictures (like me) or maximum

<br>doing prime focus imaging mostly, or piggyback with lenses?

Hi Will,
<br>
<br>Your question is best directed to the Digital Astro group,
<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/digital_astro/
<br>
<br>With over 9800 members they have quite a few comet photographers.
<br>
<br>If I were buying a digital camera for comet photography, I'd get the

<br>http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Astral-Specialized-Canon-
<br>Coming-to-US-in-July.htm
<br>
<br>I use a cooled CCD camera for comet photography because
<br>1) It has about 20 times the sensitivity of a digital camera, 40
<br>times when binned 2x2
<br>2) Color is not important to me when imaging faint comets
<br>
<br>The low-end SBIG camera costs less than the Canon and the
<br>StarlightXpress cameras are in the same price range.

<br>Hubble Captures Outburst from Comet Targeted By Deep Impact
<br>http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/16/image/a
<br>website has picture
<br>
<br>In a dress rehearsal for the rendezvous between NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft
<br>and comet 9P/Tempel 1, the Hubble Space Telescope captured dramatic images of
<br>a new jet of dust streaming from the icy comet.
<br> The images are a reminder that Tempel 1's icy nucleus, roughly half the size
<br>of Manhattan, is dynamic and volatile. Astronomers hope the eruption of dust
<br>seen in these observations is a preview of the fireworks that may come July 4,
<br>when a probe from the Deep Impact spacecraft will slam into the comet,
<br>possibly blasting off material and giving rise to a similar dust plume.
<br> These observations demonstrate that Hubble's sharp "eye" can see exquisite
<br>details of the comet's temperamental activities. The Earth-orbiting observatory
<br>was 75 million miles away from the comet when these images were taken by the
<br>Advanced Camera for Surveys' High Resolution Camera. The telescope's views
<br>complement close-up images being taken by cameras aboard Deep Impact, which is
<br>speeding toward the comet.
<br> The two images, taken seven hours apart on June 14, show Tempel 1 and its
<br>new jet. The image at left, taken at 2:17 a.m. (EDT), is a view of the comet
<br>before the outburst. The bright dot is light reflecting from the comet's nucleus,
<br>which appears star-like in these images because it is too small even for
<br>Hubble to resolve. The nucleus, a potato-shaped object, is 8.7 miles (14
<br>kilometers) wide and 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) long. Hubble's viewing the nucleus is as
<br>difficult as someone trying to spot a potato in Salt Lake City from New York
<br>City.
<br> The photo at right, snapped at 9:15 a.m. (EDT), reveals the jet [the bright
<br>fan-shaped area]. The jet extends about 1,400 miles (2,200 kilometers), which
<br>is roughly half the distance across the U.S. It is pointing in the direction
<br>of the Sun. Comets frequently show outbursts in activity, but astronomers still
<br>don't know exactly why they occur. Tempel 1 has been moving closer to the
<br>Sun, and perhaps the increasing heat opened up a crack in the comet's dark,
<br>crusty surface. Dust and gas trapped beneath the surface could then spew out of the
<br>crack, forming a jet. Or, perhaps a portion of the crust itself was lifted
<br>off the nucleus by the pressure of heated gases beneath the surface. This porous
<br>crust might then crumble into small dust particles shortly after leaving the
<br>nucleus, producing a fan-shaped coma on the sunward side. Whatever the cause,
<br>the new feature may not last for long.
<br> Astronomers hope that the July 4 collision will unleash more primordial
<br>material trapped inside the comet, which formed billions of years ago. Comets are
<br>thought to be "dirty snowballs," porous agglomerates of ice and rock that
<br>dwell in the frigid outer boundaries of our solar system. Periodically, they make
<br>their journey into the inner solar system as they loop around the Sun.
<br> The contrast in these images has been enhanced to highlight the brightness
<br>of the new jet.

<br>* How to Watch July 4 Comet Impact
<br>http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050603_deep_impact.html
<br>
<br>In early July, NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft will deploy a tiny impactor to
<br>smash into the nucleus of a small comet. The idea is to excavate a sizable
<br>crater and provide valuable insight into the true nature of comets.
<br>
<br>COMET TEMPEL 1 UPDATE
<br>
<br>It's less than a month until NASA's Deep Impact mission sends a projectile
<br>to blast the icy surface of Comet Tempel 1. The comet is currently quite
<br>faint (10th magnitude) in the evening sky, appearing large but with a low
<br>surface brightness according to observers in the last few days. Details
<br>and finder charts:
<br>
<br>http://SkyandTelescope.com/observing/highlights/article_1522_1.asp
<br>
<br>* Cosmic Crash Won't Destroy Comet or Earth
<br>http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/050628_deepimpact_effect.html
<br>
<br>Late Sunday and early Monday, skywatchers might be treated to celestial
<br>fireworks unlike anything witnessed before as NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft tangles
<br>with Comet Tempel 1 on July 4.

<br>
<br>A comet that will be whacked by a NASA probe next week almost looks like its
<br>having some pre-impact jitters, flaring up in a new picture taken by the
<br>Hubble Space Telescope.

Hello all,
<br>it seems that we are living a season of splitting comets: we can confirm the presence of a secondary component within the coma of C/2005 A1 (LINEAR), as reported on M.P.E.C. 2005-N21: on a series of CCD images we obtained remotely on July 5.41, 2005, using a 0.25m f/3.4 reflector (near Mayhill, NM), it's possible to see a secondary condensation (R = 16.5) placed in PA 210 deg, almost 21 arcsec away from the main nuclues. This component show a small tail almost 20 arcsec long toward PA 250 deg, and follows the proper motion of the primary component. The primary component show a total magnitude of almost R= 12.5 (coma diameter almost 1.4 arcmin) and a nice tail 2' long toward South-West.
<br>
<br>An image link will be posted soon...

<br>> Hello all,
<br>> it seems that we are living a season of splitting comets: we can confirm the
<br>> presence of a secondary component within the coma of C/2005 A1 (LINEAR), as
<br>> reported on M.P.E.C. 2005-N21: on a series of CCD images we obtained remotely
<br>> on July 5.41, 2005, using a 0.25m f/3.4 reflector (near Mayhill, NM), it's
<br>> possible to see a secondary condensation (R = 16.5) placed in PA 210 deg,
<br>> almost 21 arcsec away from the main nuclues. This component show a small tail
<br>> almost 20 arcsec long toward PA 250 deg, and follows the proper motion of the
<br>> primary component. The primary component show a total magnitude of almost R=
<br>> 12.5 (coma diameter almost 1.4 arcmin) and a nice tail 2' long toward
<br>> South-West.
<br>>
<br>> An image link will be posted soon...
<br>>
<br>> Kind regards,
<br>> Giovanni Sostero and Ernesto Guido

<br>
<br>Hello,
<br>the time was 09h 50m U.T. on July 5, 2005. At that moment the comet was almost 28 deg above the horizon of the NM Skies Observatory.
<br>Cheers,

Hello:  I was fortunate to be able to acquire a series of 2-minute
<br>images of comet Tempel 1 during the impact Sunday evening (California
<br>time).  While the comet itself was not much to look at, and the
<br>visual changes subtle, CCD imaging revealed a dramatic increase in
<br>brightness.  The following link contains the story and accompanying

fyi
<br>
<br>at http://spaceweather.com/
<br>take a look and see the picture of comet Tempel 1 just before the impactor
<br>struck it - craters and more
<br>see also at
<br>http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html
<br>then below is the link for the gallery
<br>
<br>at this site is the latest deep impact pictures
<br>http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/main/index.html
<br>then this more below the link
<br>
<br>Here on Earth, the "brilliant flash" was hidden from direct view by Tempel
<br>1's huge atmosphere. Indeed, the appearance of the comet hardly changed at
<br>first. But, eventually, the comet did brighten as the impact plume billowed out of
<br>the crater. The plume did not glow on its own, but rather reflected sunlight
<br>to Earth, more and more as the plume expanded.
<br>
<br>(see this pic on spaceweather)
<br>
<br> This image from a 14-inch telescope in Arizona is an example of the view
<br>from Earth. It consists of 25 exposures spanning 2 hours and 40 minutes with the
<br>impact in the middle. There was no sudden flash, but a gradual, sustained
<br>increase in the comet's overall brightness. The total change amounted to about 2
<br>magnitudes. Image credit: Rocky Alvey, Terry Mann, A.G. Kasselberg and Richard
<br>Berry of Vanderbilt University and the Astronomical League.
<br> Contrary to expectations, Comet Tempel 1 did not become a naked-eye object
<br>as a result of the collision. A telescope is still required to view the comet:
<br>observing tips.

<br>Nice photos of the 3. They are varied in magnitude. I am still trying catch
<br>161P/Hartley-IRAS although I caught Q2 again (which I would have caught it

<br>Nice photos of the 3. They are varied in magnitude. I am still trying catch
<br>161P/Hartley-IRAS although I caught Q2 again (which I would have caught it
<br>sooner to see the longer tail). 2005N1 Juels-Holvorcem is too low for my latitude.
<br>
<br>Where are you located? I could not ascertain.

<br>
<br>Scientists measure how deep 'Deep Impact' was, with X-rays
<br>Pennsylvania State University
<br>July 8, 2005
<br>
<br>University Park, Pa. -- Here come the X-rays, on cue. Scientists
<br>studying the Deep Impact collision using NASA's Swift satellite report
<br>that comet Tempel 1 is getting brighter and brighter in X-ray light with
<br>each passing day.
<br>
<br>The X-rays provide a direct measurement of how much material was kicked
<br>up in the impact. This is because the X-rays are created by the newly
<br>liberated material lifted into the comet's thin atmosphere and
<br>illuminated by the high-energy solar wind from the sun. The more
<br>material liberated, the more X-rays are produced.
<br>
<br>Swift data of the water evaporation on comet Tempel 1 also may provide
<br>new insights into how solar wind can strip water from planets such as Mars.
<br>
<br>"Prior to its rendezvous with the Deep Impact probe, the comet was a
<br>rather dim X-ray source," said Paul O'Brien of the Swift team at the
<br>University of Leicester. "How things change when you ram a comet with a
<br>copper probe traveling over 20,000 miles per hour. Most of the X-ray
<br>light we detect now is generated by debris created by the collision. We
<br>can get a solid measurement of the amount of material released."
<br>
<br>"It takes several days after an impact for surface and sub-surface
<br>material to reach the comet's upper atmosphere, or coma," said Dick
<br>Willingale, also of the University of Leicester. "We expect the X-ray
<br>production to peak this weekend. Then we will be able to assess how much
<br>comet material was released from the impact."
<br>
<br>Based on preliminary X-ray analysis, O'Brien estimates that several tens
<br>of thousands of tons of material were released, enough to bury Penn
<br>State's football field under 30 feet of comet dust. Observations and
<br>analysis are ongoing at the Swift Mission Operations Center at Penn
<br>State as well as in Italy and the United Kingdom.
<br>
<br>Swift is providing the only simultaneous multi-wavelength observation of
<br>this rare event, with a suite of instruments capable of detecting
<br>visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays. Different
<br>wavelengths reveal different secrets about the comet.
<br>
<br>The Swift team hopes to compare the satellite's ultraviolet data,
<br>collected hours after the collision, with the X-ray data. The
<br>ultraviolet light was created by material entering into the lower region
<br>of the comet's atmosphere; the X-rays come from the upper regions. Swift
<br>is a nearly ideal observatory for making these comet studies, as it
<br>combines both a rapidly responsive scheduling system with both X-ray and
<br>optical/UV instruments in the same satellite.
<br>
<br>"For the first time, we can see how material liberated from a comet's
<br>surface migrates to the upper reaches of its atmosphere," said John
<br>Nousek, director of Mission Operations at Penn State. "This will provide
<br>fascinating information about a comet's atmosphere and how it interacts
<br>with the solar wind. This is all virgin territory."
<br>
<br>Nousek said Deep Impact's collision with comet Tempel 1 is like a
<br>controlled laboratory experiment of the type of slow evaporation process
<br>from solar wind that took place on Mars. The Earth has a magnetic field
<br>that shields us from solar wind, a particle wind composed mostly of
<br>protons and electrons moving at nearly light speed. Mars lost its
<br>magnetic field billions of years ago, and the solar wind stripped the
<br>planet of water.
<br>
<br>Comets, like Mars and Venus, have no magnetic fields. Comets become
<br>visible largely because ice is evaporated from their surface with each
<br>close passage around the Sun. Water is dissociated into its component
<br>atoms by the bright sunlight and swept away by the fast-moving and
<br>energetic solar wind. Scientists hope to learn about this evaporation
<br>process on Tempel 1 now occurring quickly -- over the course of a few
<br>weeks instead of a billion years -- as the result of a planned, human
<br>intervention.
<br>
<br>Swift's "day job" is detecting distant, natural explosions called
<br>gamma-ray bursts and creating a map of X-ray sources in the universe.
<br>Swift's extraordinary speed and agility enable scientists to follow
<br>Tempel 1 day by day to see the full effect from the Deep Impact collision.

<br>NASA'S DEEP IMPACT TELLS A TALE OF THE COMET
<br>
<br>Data from Deep Impact's instruments indicate an immense
<br>cloud of fine powdery material was released when the probe
<br>slammed into the nucleus of comet Tempel 1 at 6.3 miles per
<br>second.
<br>
<br>The cloud indicated the comet is covered in the powdery stuff.
<br>The Deep Impact science team continues to wade through
<br>gigabytes of data collected during the July 4 encounter with
<br>the 3-mile-wide by 7-mile-long comet.
<br>
<br>"The major surprise was the opacity of the plume the impactor
<br>created and the light it gave off," said Deep Impact Principal
<br>Investigator Dr. Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland,
<br>College Park. "That suggests the dust excavated from the
<br>comet's surface was extremely fine, more like talcum powder
<br>than beach sand. And the surface is definitely not what most
<br>people think of when they think of comets -- an ice cube."
<br>
<br>How can a comet hurtling through our solar system be made of a
<br>substance with less strength than snow or even talcum powder?
<br>"You have to think of it in the context of its environment,"
<br>said Pete Schultz, Deep Impact scientist from Brown University,
<br>Providence, R.I. "This city-sized object is floating around in
<br>a vacuum. The only time it gets bothered is when the sun cooks
<br>it a little or someone slams an 820-pound wakeup call at it at
<br>23,000 miles per hour."
<br>
<br>The data review process is not overlooking a single frame of
<br>approximately 4,500 images from the spacecraft's three imaging
<br>cameras taken during the encounter. "We are looking at
<br>everything from the last moments of the impactor to the final
<br>look-back images taken hours later, and everything in between,"
<br>added A'Hearn. "Watching the last moments of the impactor's
<br>life is remarkable. We can pick up such fine surface detail
<br>that objects that are only four meters in diameter can be made
<br>out. That is nearly a factor of 10 better than any previous
<br>comet mission."
<br>
<br>The final moments of the impactor's life are important,
<br>because they set the stage for all subsequent scientific
<br>findings. Knowing the location and angle the impactor
<br>slammed into the comet's surface is the best place to start.
<br>Engineers have established the impactor took two not unexpected
<br>coma particle hits prior to impact. The impacts slewed the
<br>spacecraft's camera for a few moments before the attitude
<br>control system could get it back on track. The penetrator hit
<br>at an approximately 25 degree oblique angle relative to the
<br>comet's surface. That's when the fireworks began.
<br>
<br>The fireball of vaporized impactor and comet material shot
<br>skyward. It expanded rapidly above the impact site at
<br>approximately 3.1 miles per second, and the crater was just
<br>beginning to form. Scientists are still analyzing the data
<br>to determine the exact size of the crater. Scientists say
<br>the crater was at the large end of original expectations,
<br>which was from 50 to 250 meters.
<br>
<br>Expectations for Deep Impact's flyby spacecraft were exceeded
<br>during its close brush with the comet. The craft is more
<br>than 2.2 million miles from Tempel 1 and opening the distance
<br>at approximately 23,000 mph. The flyby spacecraft is
<br>undergoing a thorough checkout, and all systems appear to
<br>be in excellent operating condition.
<br>
<br>The Deep Impact mission was implemented to provide a glimpse
<br>beneath the surface of a comet, where material from the solar
<br>system's formation remains relatively unchanged. Mission
<br>scientists hoped the project would answer basic questions
<br>about the formation of the solar system by providing an
<br>in-depth picture of the nature and composition of comets.

<br>Impact mission science, and project management is handled by

<br>Subject: Deep Impact Was a Dust-up, Not a Gusher
<br>
<br>http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/pr0523.html
<br>
<br>Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
<br>
<br>Press Release No.: 05-23
<br>For Immediatie Release: July 8, 2005
<br>
<br>Deep Impact Was a Dust-up, Not a Gusher
<br>
<br>Cambridge, MA - Smithsonian astronomers watched as the "Impactor" probe
<br>from NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft hit Comet Tempel 1 earlier this week.
<br>They monitored the impact using the ground-based Submillimeter Array
<br>(SMA) in Hawaii and NASA's orbiting Submillimeter Wave Astronomy
<br>Satellite (SWAS). Results are still coming in, but so far the scientists
<br>report seeing only weak emission from water vapor and a host of other
<br>gases that were expected to erupt from the impact site. The most
<br>conspicuous feature of the blast was brightening due to sunlight
<br>scattered by the ejected dust.
<br>
<br>"It's pretty clear that this event did not produce a gusher," said SWAS
<br>principal investigator Gary Melnick of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
<br>for Astrophysics (CfA). "The more optimistic predictions for water
<br>output from the impact haven't materialized, at least not yet."
<br>
<br>Astronomer Charlie Qi (CfA) expressed surprise at these results. He
<br>explained that short-period comets like Tempel 1 have been baked
<br>repeatedly by the sun during their passages through the inner solar
<br>system. The effects of that heat are estimated to extend more than three
<br>feet beneath the surface of the nucleus. But the Deep Impact indicates
<br>that these effects could be much deeper.
<br>
<br>"Theories about the volatile layers below the surface of short-period
<br>comets are going to have to be revised," Qi said.
<br>
<br>As seen from Earth, a comet typically displays a fuzzy round head and a
<br>glowing tail. Both the head and tail consist of gases and dust ejected
<br>from the comet's nucleus - a frozen chunk of rock and ice about half the
<br>size of Manhattan Island.
<br>
<br>Five decades ago, Harvard astronomer Fred Whipple developed a model of
<br>comet nuclei as "dirty snowballs." He hypothesized that comets consist
<br>of mostly ice with some dirt and rock mixed in. Modern astronomers often
<br>refer to comets as "icy dirtballs" instead, reflecting the prevailing
<br>view that comets contain more dust and less ice than previously believed.
<br>
<br>Deep Impact was intended to test these theories by excavating material
<br>from the comet's interior, giving scientists clues to its composition
<br>and structure. The mission succeeded admirably, pulverizing a section of
<br>the comet larger than a house and releasing tons of material into space.
<br>
<br>SWAS operators were puzzled by the lack of increased water vapor from
<br>Tempel 1. Post-impact measurements showed the comet was releasing only
<br>about 550 pounds of water per second-an emission rate very similar to
<br>pre-impact values, and less than seen by SWAS during natural outbursts
<br>in the weeks before the impact.
<br>
<br>SMA measurements corroborate the SWAS findings. Although the SMA wasn't
<br>tuned to frequencies of water emission, which are difficult to observe
<br>from the ground due to atmospheric water vapor, it watched for other
<br>chemicals such as hydrogen cyanide. SMA astronomers saw little increase
<br>in production of gases following the impact. Gas production rates
<br>remained so low that they could set only an upper limit on the total.
<br>
<br>"All we needed was a factor of three boost from the impact to get a
<br>definite detection," said Qi. "We didn't see that."
<br>
<br>Qi added that the comet might become more active over the following days
<br>and weeks. "We're still hoping for a big outgassing from the new active
<br>area created by Deep Impact. If we see any signs of that, we'll make
<br>more observations."
<br>
<br>The researchers will continue their careful and detailed analysis in
<br>order to interpret the SMA and SWAS measurements and what they indicate
<br>about the comet's composition.
<br>
<br>"The big picture will emerge once astronomers meld data from different
<br>observatories at different wavelengths," said Melnick.
<br>
<br>Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
<br>Astrophysics (CfA) is a joint collaboration between the Smithsonian
<br>Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory. CfA
<br>scientists, organized into six research divisions, study the origin,

eah 2004 K1 was a nice test subject for my new camera. I just got a

<br> Jul 25, 2005 - The powerful Palomar observatory has released its before and
<br>after images of Comet Tempel 1 after it was struck by Deep Impact. In the
<br>earliest images taken after impact, the photos show a plume of material extending
<br>320 km (200 miles) from the comet's centre. This dust plume lasted for several
<br>nights, and allowed astronomers to measure its rotation. Two days later
<br>another, smaller plume was visible, which could have vented from an outburst of gas
<br>and dust coming from the impact site.

Hi,
<br>I would like to attempt to capture a color image of a meteor during the
<br>upcoming peak of Perseids. I will be mounting a Canon 20D with either a
<br>20mm or 50mm lens piggybacked on a AP mount. I will probably be taking

<br>
<br>Is it best to point the camera at the radiant or somewhere away from

Hi Rick..
<br>By all means do not point at the radiant; the best show will always be where you are not
<br>looking, but find one part of the sky and stay with it pretty much for the duration if you
<br>can.  I always recommend directly overhead from about 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. and then shifting
<br>the camera to a half-way point between overhead and the western or southwestern horizon
<br>for the rest of the morning.....best of success!

<br>if you have the choice, take the shortest focal length you have. I

<br>
<br>With 8 mm it doesn't matter, because it's near all sky. But we pointed
<br>to the zenit with a slight direction to the eastern horizon.

It is interesting that this apparent separation between the two components is essentially

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Greetings.  Over the past few months I have revisited some older comet
<br>images.  I was never really satisified with the outcome of some images,
<br>so I have been trying some new process from around the web most which
<br>are applied to deep space images.  The fast movement of comets usually
<br>does not allow for straight forward processing so I had to pick and
<br>choose to see what might work and use some of my own ideas.  Most of
<br>this was on the head portion trying to keep the overexposed areas
<br>down.  Anyway I though I would process and publish one of these images
<br>here.
<br> This is Q2 from January 05.  File is about 650kb.
<br>Thanks, Mike H.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>well I tried to visually see newly discovered C/2005 T4 (SWAN) a few hours ago in the western sky. I didn't definitely see it, but thought I saw a VERY faint smudge at a spot different to the predicted position (read below). I also imaged it...
<br>
<br>C/2005 T4 (SWAN)
<br>
<br>2005 October 25.34 UT: m1 = ~12.0 - 13.0, Dia.= -, DC = -,  41cm f4.5 Reflect (83x). John Drummond, (Gisborne, New Zealand)  [New Comet SWAN (C/2005 T4) was not definately seen visually. It's very low in the  western sky <8* above the horizon. Can see stars to mag 13.5. Interestingly I THOUGHT at times I could detect a FAINT smudge about 4' to the NW of mag 10.5 star TYC 563143 but dismissed it due to it being in a different location than the predicted one (on GUIDE using the IAU ephemerides) - it was that faint and vague that I thought it was just my eyes/mind playing tricks on me. However exposures show the smudges location to be the comet! Based on these images as at 25.36 October (UT) I get a position of RA 16h 33m 05s, Dec 09h 55m 57s. I guess the m1 visual mag was ~12.0 - 13.0. Imaged T4 when it was only 3* altitude in the west. Stellar VLM = 13.5 (scope)].
<br>
<br>An image (comet was only about 3 degrees above the horizon) can be seen at:

<br>> Hi all,
<br>>
<br>> I imaged comets C/2005 B1 and C/2005 E2 on Monday 31st October 2005... B1 was next to a
<br>globular cluster.
<br>>
<br>> 2004 B1 (LINEAR) and NGC 1841 (Globular Cluster) - two images, one stacked on the comet,
<br>the other on stacked on NGC 1841

I finished imaging C/2005 E2 and thought just one more comet sitting in
<br>a straight up position without a Moon and really clear fall skys.  I
<br>either missed it or it has really gone down hill over the last couple

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>I hope to have clear skies sometime soon so I can contribute some
<br>images again.
<br>
<br>Is that blooming on the bright stars from the Maxcam 10?

Hi Dennis.  Sounds good to have images posted.  A comet is a comet no
<br>matter how big or small.
<br>  Yes that is blooming.  The chip  is not antiblooming.  I wanted as
<br>much info gathered in the smallest amount of time.  I also did not
<br>have a cover installed over the chip to reduce reflections.  As soon
<br>as I learn how to use the camera properly, I will remove the blooms
<br>as time allows.  Mike

Thanks Dennis,
<br>
<br>Yes the moon was bright.
<br>
<br>P/2005 R2 seems to show a little more activity than 29P.
<br>
<br>I want to try an hours worth of images soon and stack them to check
<br>if there is more to see.
<br>
<br>Its taken me quite a while to work up to this point.

Nice image Mike, I managed to see it visually in my 12.5" f/5.6
<br>reflector from the light polluted skies of Ann Arbor, MI on November
<br>20th at about 18:45 EST. It appear as a small almost stellar spot
<br>just about 5' due west of a 6.8 magnitude star. I could just make out
<br>a little diffused coma extending about 2.5' north east.
<br>You are right about it being the best show in town, but you'll have

Hello Eric.  Actually I did try for the top award.  I sent images of
<br>more than enough comets to qualify but was told that not enough
<br>information was given.  The club I am a member of, "WWW.AOAS.ORG", is
<br>a member of the league and so for them I tried.  O-well, maybe next

Thanks Dennis. C/2005 E2 is very low to the south from
<br>my location around 32 degrees N. Can you see it at
<br>your latitude?
<br>
<br>Its pretty easy to spot with a CCD. Its showing up
<br>even when I am focusing with 4 second shots.
<br>
<br>My problem is trees on my south side at that
<br>declination. The recent weather here blew away the
<br>fall leaves. I have to catch it between tree limbs.

<br>Charles.  Nice images.  How do you like the color ST2000?  I have one
<br>of the first ST2000XM's.  Your image is interesting.  I thought you
<br>would show the curved tail but see no sign.  The link has an image
<br>from Rolando L. showing this event.  I hope to once again put the
<br>comet on a chip over the next couple of weeks.  Later Mike H.

<br>Hi, at this address I have update the web pages of comet C/2005 E2.
<br>
<br>http://comete.uai.it/2005e2/index.htm
<br>
<br>The photographed curved tail on December 11 is not seen more, perhaps accomplice also the
<br>presence of the full Moon, but in all the images it is present a component to PA 240.
<br>
<br>Could she be this a perspective vision of the dusts?
<br>
<br>regards
<br>Rolando

Thanks for the nice comments Mike. The ST-2000XCM is my first real
<br>CCD camera. It was a giant step up from a Meade imager. The addition
<br>of the AO-7 finally allowed much longer self guided exposures. The
<br>periodic error in the Meade mount has been the biggest challenge.
<br>
<br>I have been imaging at f/10. Over the last few months I was able to
<br>image fainter comets like 29P, C/2003 K4, C/2005A1, and P/2005 R2.
<br>
<br>To go deeper I will have to try a focal reducer. There were
<br>troublesome internal reflections the last time I tried the Meade
<br>F/6.3 FR. Perhaps I will try the camera with the F/3.3 focal reducer
<br>but without the AO-7.
<br>
<br>I have not seen anything to suggest a bent tail on C/2005 E2. All I
<br>see is a basic symmetric radial spread of light emanating from the
<br>comet. The spread seems to be approximately perpendicular to the
<br>direction of apparent movement.
