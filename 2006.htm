Hi all,
<br>
<br>On the 2nd Jan 2006 (from 11:00 until 11:30pm local NZDT) - (UT 2006 January 02, 10:00 - 10:30) I imaged Comet 2004 B1 sitting about 2.5' to the west of mag 12.8 (3.2' x 1.3') galaxy NGC 6887 in Telescopium. Sorry that the image isn't the best as the comet was only about 10 degrees above the SW horizon.

Once in a while something really happens to grab your attention.  At

<br>is a two frame animation of Comet C/2005 E2.  What got me was the
<br>almost mirror object.  I reprocessed and combined the images 24x45 and
<br>stacked on the comet.  Still looked good so I reprocessed and stacked
<br>on the stars.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hi all,
<br>
<br>well I just visually observed and imaged newly discovered comet C/2006A1 (Pojmanski). It was easy to spot with my 16" Dob from my dark site - even with the nearly 1/4 Moon in the sky. I think it's brighter than what was suggested. Below is my observation and a webpage URL to images of the comet.
<br>
<br>C/2006 A1 (Pojmanski). 2006 January 06 .40 UT: m1 = 10.5, Dia.= 2'.5, DC = 2,  41cm f4.5 Reflect (83x). John Drummond, (Gisborne, New Zealand)  [Was easy to spot this (A1) newly discovered comet through my 41cm (16") Dob - even with the 6 day Moon in the evening sky (I have a dark, rural sky). C/2006A1 appears as a diffuse coma with no noticeable central condensation. Used three stars for a mag estimate (s). No evident tail. 29d alt in the SW. Stellar LM =14.3 (scope)].
<br>
<br>Images can be seen at:

<br>http://www.possumobservatory.co.nz/comet_2006a1_pojmanski.htm
<br>
<br>or
<br>
<br>http://tinyurl.com/dsxl5
<br>
<br>For astrometry I took two 1 minute images with my Canon 10D DSLR and the 41cm @ f4.5 an hour apart - one at 0900 UT, the second at 1000 UT (Jan 06, 2006). These images are visible on the above webpage. Based on these images and GUIDE 8.0 software I determined (by comparing the images with the computer screen) that the positions were:
<br>
<br>2006 Jan 06 0900UT - RA: 21h 25m 08.32s   Dec: -66d 38' 30.8"
<br>
<br>2006 Jan 06 1000UT - RA: 21h 25m 02.48s   Dec: -66d 37' 35.2"
<br>
<br>I realise this isn't as accurate as an astrometric software program but it's the best I can do - I think the positions are pretty close...
<br>
<br>It's nice to have a fairly bright comet in the sky again!
<br>
<br>Cheers.

I agree with John's observations - except for one issue. The level of condensation.
<br>
<br> I have looked at the light profile of the comet in my CCD images - using the profiling tool in AstroArt. What this shows is a relatively bright nucleus having a similar brightness distribution to stellar images. And a relatively faint but broad coma. I have no idea what the comet looks like 'visually' (the nuclear magnitude that I have measured is at around 15), but my imaging is consistent with a relatively bright nuclear region of only a few arcsecs diameter, with a broad coma extending to somewhat over 1 arcmin. The following table, at approx 2" intervals across the comet, gives an indication (the distance units are approximately arcsecs)
<br>
<br>Dist    flux (above nominal background)
<br>-40      ~0
<br>-30     120
<br>-20     220

<br>This distribution is inconsistent with a weakly condensed comet. I guess there are two possible explanations. Either I am seeing the nucleus, and the coma is broad with little condensation. Or the comet has a very strong central condensation. I guess time will tell.....

Hi Dave,
<br>
<br>I suspect that the CCD is seeing deeper into the coma's shroud than the
<br>naked eye can - that is, spotting the nucleus. I note that my images also
<br>show a fairly condensed nucleus (but this can be influenced by how I stretch
<br>the image in PS), something that isn't as evident visually. I see that
<br>Alexandre Amorim of Brazil also suggests a coma of 3 - as does another
<br>Australian observer of note.

Dear All,
<br>
<br>Professional observations of Comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) were made
<br>during 20:40 - 23:00 UT on January 20, 2005.
<br>
<br>To help interpret these observations, we wish to obtain amateur images
<br>of the comet taken within a day on either side of the above period.
<br>Images taken during the observing period itself would be particularly
<br>valuable.
<br>
<br>If anyone has suitable images, please get in touch by replying
<br>off-list to this message - we'd be extremely grateful for any help.
<br>The contribution of everyone with whom we collaborate will of course
<br>be acknowledged in any resulting publication.

I have uploaded a composite image taken a short time ago (to the photos section of -ml,and files section of -images).
<br>Comet altitude about 18 degrees - and getting very difficult to get a decent long exposure after twilight and before one
<br>or more of - (i) setting behind a tree, (ii) my telescope pointing at a light pole, or (iii) my telescope pointing at
<br>the roof of my observatory.
<br>
<br>Anyway - the two exposures are each of 4 mins, with a gap of several minutes between (so while the stars are properly
<br>aligned, there is a small displacement in the tail). I haven't done any field flattening or any processing other than
<br>setting a compatible range. The distance from top to bottom is about 14 arc mins - so the tail is a good 10 arc mins
<br>long - in PA 165. Obviously it is still very faint - I doubt it could be observed visually at the moment....

<br>Just type 2000 EC98 (but do no enter P/2000 EC98 or C/2000 EC98 ! This
<br>peculiar comet is referenced as a minor planet) in the Minor Planet et
<br>Comet Ephemeris Service :
<br>
<br>http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/MPEph/MPEph.html
<br>
<br>and you will get orbital elements and an ephemeris for it.
<br>
<br>A very beautiful object, Good observations !

My problem is my horizon. The comet has now moved to a position where it has set behind a neighbour's tree well before civil twilight - and I can even get images earlier in the twilight for astrometry measurement. So the image I posted the other week showing the tail remains the best by far that are available. I do have a couple of subsequent images - but the quality is much less due to twilight and partial aperture cur-off.
<br>
<br>In a couple of weeks, I should be able to get images in the morning sky. But my neighbour has a large tree - much higher than the 17 deg altitude cut-off I have at the evening location. But as soon as I can, you can be assured that I will post some more images.

Hi Dave and all
<br>
<br>Get out your axe, and do what must be done in the middle of the night!  Just
<br>joking!  But seriously, a friend of mine Richard Fleet here in Zimbabwe at
<br>the time (left the country now, like most others) did exactly that back in
<br>'86. There was a neighbour's tree that was blocking his view of Halley's
<br>post- perihelion recovery.  The neighbour didn't even notice as he had a
<br>virtual forest in his backyard anyway.  My friend chose the one tree that
<br>was blocking the specific azimuth and altitude that he had established for
<br>the recovery.
<br>
<br>He went and did the "deed" and as a result got the very first visual
<br>post-perihelion observation in the world of Halley on February 15.128 UT
<br>1986.
<br>
<br>Terry Lovejoy got it a little later at Feb 15.784 UT and cruised in to third
<br>place...but I don't know whether he had to resort to such extreme methods!
<br>Terry, want to share your recovery observation with us?  (Note that in those
<br>days we had to report the time of observation to three decimal places!)
<br>
<br>Just thought I would share this little bit of "comet crime" with you and the
<br>ml group!
<br>
<br>Regards
<br>

I would dearly love to cut down the tree! But it is a little complicated. The tree is in actually in a laneway between me and my neighbour. In fact there are three of them close together. The other day, one of them dropped a large branch onto the power line to my house - I was lucky that the line didn't break. Anyway the 'Authorities' have agreed to remove that tree, but not the others. And we have local laws that prevent chopping down trees..... I just need to figure out how to make the other two 'fall over', or otherwise become dangerous to people using the path (without them actually being dangerous)

Hi Clay!
<br>
<br>Oh.........good one!  This was hilarious, and you really made my day!!!!

<br>My wife Lorna couldn't understand why I was laughing so much until I could
<br>recover my breath and read your comment to her.

<br>Thanks so much!

<br>I would convince the authorities that all three trees are close relatives
<br>and
<br>therefore prone for the same psychological stress disorder that results in
<br>continued property damage.  That works for human restraining orders.

Well if you have trees, you know, you have trees.  Sometimes, and I
<br>say sometimes they can be a problem for a while.  I remember a couple
<br>of years ago my neighbors house to the S/W was in the way.  Jokingly
<br>I ask him to open his front and back door so I could image a comet
<br>through his house that was setting behind his place.  He did!  The
<br>only think worse than him doing that was me actually trying to look
<br>through his open doors!.  My wife told me that sometimes you have
<br>just got to draw the line somewhere and I had ought to
<br>apologise.        Mike

<br>the tail remains the best by far that are available. I do have a
<br>couple of subsequent images - but the quality is much less due to
<br>twilight and partial aperture cur-off.

<br>> In a couple of weeks, I should be able to get images in the morning
<br>sky. But my neighbour has a large tree - much higher than the 17 deg
<br>altitude cut-off I have at the evening location. But as soon as I
<br>can, you can be assured that I will post some more images.

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>I agree, where are my images? My problems are that I had to give a number of
<br>papers at an astronomy conference and needed to get some urgent images done
<br>for the talks. Also, a NZ publishing company is wanting some images of a
<br>certain object by a certain date for a book. And then to really top it off,
<br>my father died a few days ago. Hopefully things will settle down over the
<br>next few days - but, sadly, they won't be as they used to be, with no 'dad'

Hi John

<br>Best wishes and condolences from here too...I know what it is like...my own

<br>Hi Doug,
<br>if we consider the astrometric-derived "N" (nuclear) magnitude,  then on 2006 Feb.6.4 we measured it as 16.8 (unfiltered, USNO-B1.0 catalogue), that isn't too different from your values, considering the error bars.
<br>Thanks for your valuable input!
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

Sits pretty low at Sunset in the W-SW sky.  The tail is still all

Hi all,
<br>
<br>last night (centred on Tuesday 08.60 February UT) I imaged Comet 73P (Schwassmann-Wachmann) with my 16" f4.5 Newt and a Canon 10D DSLR. The FOV is about 30' x 20'. East is to the right, North is down. There is an interesting appearance just to the right (east) of the comet that looks like a fainter comet with a tail pointing the other way! I presume it's an image defect... I stacked 9 x 3 minute sub-exposures (800 ISO).
<br>
<br>The galaxy at 5 O'clock to the comet is mag 13 galaxy NGC 5162 - and mag 16 galaxy UGC 8486 further on.
<br>
<br>The image can be seen at:

<br>
<br>After 73P I lined up on C/2006 A1, saw it big and bright in my camera view finder, was just going to start an exposure, and...it clouded over ##@#@#!!
<br>
<br>Cheers.

Hi all,
<br>FWIW - I was messing around with a Canon 350D at the dark site whilst
<br>there this morning just gone, only using a tripod, and no remote, plus
<br>hand/eye focus. 25 sec exp. 1600 iso with the dog awful kit f/5 zoom
<br>lens that comes with 350d, also my first attempt at a long exposure at
<br>a dark site with it.
<br>  My 350D seems to be one of the ones with the bad banding - although
<br>that can be processed out of course.
<br>  Processing in CS only - very (non-biased) stretched and some usm - ,
<br>as I am unfamiliar with deep sky digital processing atm.
<br>Please excuse the hot pixels and all ;-) ! dont laugh!

<br>Dennis, the other 'comet' is the next object immediately to the right (east)
<br>of 73P - the faint 'tail' extends up from it at 2-3 O'clock and heads
<br>roughly towards tie bright mag 5 star. If you can't see it I'll provide

Have you considered the geometry of this comet at the moment? It is on the other side of the sun at a heliocentric distance of about 2.2AU, and a geocentric distance of about 1.5AU. So the tail is directed away from the Earth, and we are looking 'along' it. If the dust tail is trailing the motion of the comet (with the tail being generally directed away from the sun) it is to be expected that the dust tail would appear to be on the sunward side of the comet - depending upon the viewing geometry. That is, what you have imaged is a dust tail physically directed away from the sun, but lagging behind the comet's actual motion in space. [If there was also an ion tail, you would expect (in the current geometry) that tail to be pointing in the opposite direction.]

<br>Yes, according to Guide 8, the tail is about 180 degrees from where

See my earlier message (where I got the geocentric and heliocentric distances back-to-front).
<br>
<br>In particular, the Earth-comet-sun angle is only about 23 degrees. If the tail is lagging the comet in its actual orbit about the sun by more than 23 degs, the  tail will appear on the opposite side to the comet/antisun vector - and thus 'appear' to be on the sunward side of the comet.

Hi,
<br>IMHO the explanation of Dave is reasonable: this structure pointing to
<br>the Sun has been observed since several weeks now, and we are missing
<br>the physical conditions for a real anti-tail (anti neck-line) since we
<br>were well before perihelium. It could be something similar to the
<br>apparent anti-tail (the ordinary dust tail seen toward solar direction
<br>due to a perspective effect) we observed last year on C/2004 Q2
<br>(Machholz).

Easy to see the head. Much more condensed that my last observation (11 Jan, DC:4). I may be losing some outer coma (hence size) to the bright, moonlit sky. No tail seen - lost in the moonlight, but evident in tonight's photos (10' tail seen in 41cm scope). 16? alt in the SE. Stellar LM = ~10 near comet (scope)].

I have a Meade 14", with an Starlight Express MX716 camera. Exposure was 30 secs, unguided. I'm sure that if I had clear skies I would get a lot more detail - the comet is bright enough for me to be able to make some long exposures tracking on the comet rather than the stars.

<br>For reference: The faintest stars in the image are around 17.0. The brightest stars are about mag 12.

Subject:  Pojmanski animation
</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I've uploaded a GIF animation I created from 6 images I took of Pojmanski a few hours ago - into the files section of
<br>both groups. The file is called 'Pojmanski 2006Feb24.GIF'
<br>
<br>A few details.
<br>1. The animation consists of a sequence of 4-minute exposures, with the telescope tracking on the nucleus of the comet
<br>(Hence the comet image is totally static with respect to its orbital motion, and the stars are trailed.)
<br>2. Conversion to GIF resulted in the loss of some detail - the image is grainier than the originals
<br>3. Twilight affected the last two images - the effect being seen as a drop of brightness of the comet (and consequential
<br>reduction in the diameter of the coma.)
<br>4. Image size is 14 x 10 arcmins - so it only shows the very inner part of the tail!
<br>
<br>I did not anticipate the amount of activity in the tail that is visible in this animation. The 4-minute exposure has
<br>resulted in some loss of detail in the tail structure. If I do this again, I shall be using a shorter exposure to try to
<br>get the tail structure/motion in better detail.
<br>
<br>Finally, I can't make up my mind whether there is some indication of a faint, short dust tail extending below the ion
<br>tail. What is apparent, though, is that the outer region of the coma (as seen in the image) is not circular, and is not
<br>symmetric with the tail location (although other image analysis shows that the ion tail does point directly to the
<br>brightest point in the coma). So I'm inclined to conclude that there is a VERY weak dust tail.

Greetings.  My first image of this comet so as you could tell with the
<br>4".  The FLI Maxcam 10 is a nice improvment for the faint comets using
<br>a small scope.  Weather was ok but some high clouds and falling temps
<br>all night with a cold front made focus hard.  Info is on the image.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>I just wanted to send a 'blanket covering' email to ALL the people who have emailed me privately on getting my Comet Pojmanski image on www.spaceweather.com (Feb 26, 2006). Your congratulations have truly meant a lot to me. Thankyou.
<br>
<br>However, a small minority have sent rather nasty emails stating that I'm an evil tree murderer because I (with a bit of tongue-in-cheek) stated that I dropped an exotic (non-native) macrocarpa tree when the comet went behind it. In seriousness the tree was diseased and had 1/3 rotted on the south side - and would have fallen in a severe storm in a year or two (the foliage/leaves was already dying back). So, not wanting the tree to fall on a car and injure someone - as a man I know can attest to (he still carries a badly scarred face to this day), I decided to do a controlled drop. The comet was a catalyst to a job that needed doing...
<br>
<br>For those who wanted a larger version of the image, go to...

Thanks for this Mark; note that the elements of a splintered fragment such as
<br>this will likely change as the dynamics of the motion of the primary comet
<br>continues; however this is useful information and a good reminder on how quick

Hi Group,
<br>
<br>I imaged A1 Pojmanski Sunday morning Feb 26  from latitude 42 d 8
<br>min N (Northern Illinois) but conditions were very poor. I was
<br>pointed toward Chicago, 40 miles away, and the sky glow was
<br>terrible.  My VLM was about -2, and I could see no stars visually
<br>below Venus. My exposures were limited to 10 seconds (CCD binned 2x2
<br>at f/3.3) to avoid saturation, and I was not able to capture much of
<br>a tail.  The comet is very fast moving relative to the star field,
<br>6.4 arc seconds per minute, so I might make a movie of what I've got.
<br>
<br>I'd appreciate it if posters would give their latitude. We folks in
<br>the northern climes have a more challenging task.

Subject:  2006 A1 Pojmanski - another animation
</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I've uploaded into the files section of the Comet-Images group another animation of Pojmanski. Details are:
<br>
<br>Time - 2006 Feb 27, 18h 09m => 19h 00m UT
<br># images - 17
<br>Exposure - 3 minutes each
<br>
<br>Best viewing of the animation is obtained by running it at full size, but viewing it from a distance.
<br>
<br>At the start of the animation, the comet was at low altitude, and half the aperture of my scope was blocked by my
<br>observatory wall. At the end of the animation, twilight had become significant. These issues result in the size of eth
<br>coma (and darkness of the image) increasing in the first couple of frames. And the comet becoming fainter in the last
<br>half-dozen frames.
<br>
<br>The tail activity is not as great as for the animation of Feb 24. The most notable movement is in a knot near the right
<br>hand end of the central streamer. But other movements are noticeable.

I've posted another image of Pojmanski, for Feb 28.75 UT, in the files section of Comet-Images.
<br>
<br>The tail structure near the coma is VERY different from 24 hours ago, with there being a larger number of streamers.
<br>
<br>The comet is now getting too low for me to do any sensible animation.... Within a few days this comet will be out of my
<br>reach. I trust the northerners will enjoy this comet, which is showing considerable activity in the ion tail (but no
<br>appreciable dust tail).

Hello all,
<br>
<br>My latest images reveal Comet 2006 A1 Pojmanski is sporting a rather long
<br>ion tail.
<br>
<br>See images posted to my website at:
<br>
<br>http://www.yp-connect.net/~mmatti/
<br>
<br>Details:
<br>Comet C/2006 A1 Pojmanski on 2006 February 28.78UT.
<br>Left: 2x2 minute exposure. Canon 300D digital camera + 90mm telephoto lens.
<br>Field of View approximately 8 degrees high.
<br>Note the ion tail is at least 8 degrees in length.
<br>Alpha Capricornus is to the right.
<br>Right: 2x2 minute exposure. Canon 300D digital camera + 200mm telephoto
<br>lens. Field of View 4 degrees high.
<br>
<br>The ion tail was visible to about 5 degrees in 25x100mm and 7x50mm
<br>binoculars and the comet was faintly visible to the naked eye at magnitude
<br>5.4.

Greetings.  Took a bit of processing to remove the gradients for a

<br>If first light had not set in I could have easly increased the tail

Very nice image. In my system I can only get 0.2 deg of tail length in the field....
<br>
<br>I wouldn't mind seeing the image in negative. There appears to be a far bit of structure in the tail, and I'm sure it will be more apparent if the image is in negative form.

I've compared the image to the HeraldBobroff AstroAtlas chart covering this area (C-42). The image shows a triangle of over-exposed stars. The one at the bottom left (near the edge of the frame) is 69 Aquila. The distance from that to the other overexposed star (half-way across the image) is close to 1.0 deg. On that basis, the width of the picture is about 2.3 deg.

Thanks. The detail in the tail is much more evident. It shows a series of points along the tail where divergent structures focus. This gives me the impression that there periods of extra activity in emitting material from the nucleus, and these are evidenced by these points along the tail

<br>Hi Dave,
<br>I agree: this image confirm your previous find, since the advantage of
<br>the image-processing procedure we used, is to enhance the dust tail
<br>appendage, since most of the coma bulk is removed from the background.

<br>
<br>Hi Mike,
<br>I think that the main doubt arises for fragment "G": if Nakano is correct, we will be informed by the CBAT or the MPC that its designation has to be switched to "E", instead. However, up to an official statemnet, I will continue to call it "G". The other two are more secure, and you labelled it correctly.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

C/2006 A1 Pojmanski had a very fast relative speed of motion, 7 arc
<br>seconds per minute on March 4, making it a prime candidate for
<br>animation. (Now it is 5.9 arc seconds per minute, still pretty
<br>fast.) You can't image for long due to the speed (unless you guide),
<br>so you wind up with lots of short exposure frames.  Ideal movie
<br>material.
<br>
<br>Images and short (593 kB) movie at
<br>http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>
<br>Here's what I do in ImagesPlus:
<br>
<br>1) Stretch the midpoint frame to pleasing histogram shape and apply
<br>that histogram to all images.  The sky background may vary
<br>considerably from beginning to end, but it will look fine in the
<br>movie.
<br>2) Convert FITs to JPGs
<br>3) Align on the stars.  This is important!  If you align on the
<br>comet head, the animation will not look as pleasing.
<br>4) Crop all images down to a small size, like 300 x 200 pixels.
<br>Please <G>.  Most viewers don't want to download a 15  20 MB movie!
<br>
<br>Next, in Ulead GIF Annimator:
<br>1) Click on Annimation wizard and import the jpgs
<br>2) Preview and remove any bad frames
<br>3) Under Optimize, reduce the color bit depth from 256 bits to 16
<br>(or less) bits. This has a profound effect on reducing file size.
<br>Experiment with different settings to make the file size as small as
<br>you can without sacrificing image quality too much.
<br>4) Hope the Academy Awards will nominate your movie <G>.
<br>
<br>Notes on the software I described:
<br>
<br>Of the many image processing aps I use, ImagesPlus seems best suited
<br>for handling a hundred or so frames at once.  The "Apply to all
<br>images" command is greatly appreciated when dealing with a whole
<br>bunch of images simultaneously.
<br>
<br>Ulead GIF Animator replaced my all-time favorite Animagic. When I
<br>got a new computer I somehow lost the password to it and now it's
<br>broken. The Ulead ap is ok, gets the job done, and is easy to use.
<br>I've not tried other animation aps so I don't know how it compares.
<br>
<br>Give comet movie making a try.  It is fun and a good way to use up
<br>all of those frames you took.

There is one point in your process that I do not necessarily agree with. And that is the point about tracking on the stars rather than the comet head.
<br>
<br>If you merely want to show the comet's motion amongst the stars, I would agree with you. It is nice to have point stars. However this option necessarily limits the exposure to short times - especially for a fast-moving comet. As a result, detail in the tail is not recorded. If you want to record tail detail, with the animation showing motion of features within the tail, you need to have sufficiently long exposures to record this detail. This means tracking on the comet, not the tail.
<br>
<br>So...
<br>* imaging to show motion of the comet amongst the stars - short exposures, track on the stars;
<br>* imaging to show motion within the comet - longer exposures, track on the comet.
<br>
<br>As this group will be aware, I did several animations a few weeks ago, while the comet was still visible at my latitude (-35) - and over a 40 min period there were on occasions quite large changes in the tail. One animation shows a knot which moved over 30" along the tail. Another showed the apparent width of the tail within 5 arcmins  of the nucleus reducing by 20%. Consequently I would encourage people to do animations designed
<br>
<br>PS. I did my animations by using the images as displayed in Astrometrica. Exported each image to a BMP file (to avoid image loss at this point). Then using PAINT, saved each image as a GIF file. And then used a short utility I downloaded called 'GIF Animator' to combine the individual GIF images into an animated GIF file. Simple process, not involving anything commercial other than Astrometrica and Windows.

<br>> C/2006 A1 Pojmanski had a very fast relative speed of motion, 7 arc
<br>> seconds per minute on March 4, making it a prime candidate for
<br>> animation. (Now it is 5.9 arc seconds per minute, still pretty
<br>> fast.) You can't image for long due to the speed (unless you guide),
<br>> so you wind up with lots of short exposure frames.  Ideal movie
<br>> material.
<br>>
<br>> Images and short (593 kB) movie at
<br>> http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>>
<br>> Here's what I do in ImagesPlus:
<br>>
<br>> 1) Stretch the midpoint frame to pleasing histogram shape and apply
<br>> that histogram to all images.  The sky background may vary
<br>> considerably from beginning to end, but it will look fine in the
<br>> movie.
<br>> 2) Convert FITs to JPGs
<br>> 3) Align on the stars.  This is important!  If you align on the
<br>> comet head, the animation will not look as pleasing.
<br>> 4) Crop all images down to a small size, like 300 x 200 pixels.
<br>> Please <G>.  Most viewers don't want to download a 15 – 20 MB movie!
<br>>
<br>> Next, in Ulead GIF Annimator:
<br>> 1) Click on Annimation wizard and import the jpgs
<br>> 2) Preview and remove any bad frames
<br>> 3) Under Optimize, reduce the color bit depth from 256 bits to 16
<br>> (or less) bits. This has a profound effect on reducing file size.
<br>> Experiment with different settings to make the file size as small as
<br>> you can without sacrificing image quality too much.
<br>> 4) Hope the Academy Awards will nominate your movie <G>.

<br>Mini-Comets Approaching Earth
<br>
<br>03.24.2006
<br>
<br>A cometary "string-of-pearls" will fly past Earth in May closer than any
<br>comet has come in almost 80 years.
<br>
<br>March 24, 2006: In 1995, Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 did something
<br>unexpected: it fell apart. For no apparent reason, the comet's nucleus split into
<br>at least three "mini-comets" flying single file through space. Astronomers
<br>watched with interest, but the view was blurry even through large telescopes.
<br>"73P" was a hundred and fifty million miles away.
<br> We're about to get a much closer look. In May 2006 the fragments are going
<br>to fly past Earth closer than any comet has come in almost eighty years.

<br> "This is a rare opportunity to watch a comet in its death throesfrom very
<br>close range," says Don Yeomans, head of NASA's Near Earth Object Program at
<br>JPL.
<br> There's no danger of a collision. "Goodness, no," says Yeomans. "The closest
<br>fragment will be about six million miles away--or twenty-five times farther
<br>than the Moon." That's close without actually being scary.

<br>
<br>The flyby is a big deal. "The Hubble Space Telescope will be watching," says
<br>Yeomans. "Also, the giant Arecibo radar in Puerto Rico will 'ping' the
<br>fragments to determine their shape and spin." Even backyard astronomers will be able
<br>to take pictures as the mini-comets file through the constellations Cygnus and
<br>Pegasus on May 12, 13 and 14.
<br> Ironically these comets, so nearby, will not be very bright. The largest
<br>fragments are expected to glow like 3rd or 4th magnitude stars, only dimly
<br>visible to the unaided eye.
<br> "Remember," says Yeomans, "these are mini-comets." They're not like the
<br>Great Comets Hayutake and Hale-Bopp of 1996 and 1997. Those could be seen with the
<br>naked eye from light-polluted cities. The fragments of 73P, on the other
<br>hand, are best viewed from the countryside--and don't forget your binoculars.
<br> The number of fragments is constantly changing. When the breakup began in
<br>1995 there were only three: A, B and C. Astronomers now count at least eight:
<br>big fragments B and C plus smaller fragments G, H, J, L, M and N. "It looks as
<br>though some of the fragments are themselves forming their own sub-fragments,"
<br>says Yeomans, which means the number could multiply further as 73P approaches.
<br>No knows how long the "string of pearls" will be when it finally arrives.
<br>

<br>remote-controlled 14-inch telescope in New Mexico.
<br> Bonus: There could be a meteor shower, too.
<br> This is very uncertain, indeed, forecasters consider it unlikely. But an
<br>expanding cloud of dust from the 1995 break-up of the comet could brush past
<br>Earth in May 2006 producing a display of meteors.
<br> Astronomer Paul Wiegert at the University of Western Ontario has studied the
<br>possibility:
<br> "We believe the cloud is expanding too slowly to reach Earth only eleven
<br>years after the break-up," he says, "but it all depends on what caused the comet
<br>to fly apartand that we don't know."
<br> "The most likely explanation is thermal stress, with the icy nucleus
<br>cracking like an ice cube dropped into hot soup: the comet broke apart as it
<br>approached the Sun after a long sojourn the frigid outer solar system," he explains.
<br>"If this is truly what happened, then the debris cloud should be expanding
<br>slowly, and there will be no strong meteor shower."
<br> Right: Clouds of comet dust from Comet 73P are expected to miss Earth in
<br>2006. [More]
<br> On the other hand, what if "the comet was shattered by a hit from a small
<br>interplanetary boulder?" A violent collision could produce faster-moving debris
<br>that would reach Earth in 2006.
<br> Wiegert expects to see nothing, but he encourages sky watchers to be alert.
<br>It wouldn't be the first time a dying comet produced a meteor shower:
<br> "One outstanding example is comet Biela, which was seen to split in 1846,
<br>and had completely broken apart by 1872," he says. "At least three very intense
<br>meteor showers (3000-15000 meteors per hour) were produced by this dying comet
<br>in 1872, 1885 and 1892."
<br> Assuming a thermal breakup for 73P, Wiegert and colleagues have calculated
<br>the most likely trajectory of its dust cloud. Their results: dust should reach
<br>Earth in 2022, "producing a minor meteor shower--nothing spectacular.
<br>However," he adds, "the ongoing splitting of the comet means new meteoroids are being
<br>sent in new directions, so a future strong meteor shower from 73P remains a
<br>real possibility."
<br> The watch begins on May 12th.

<br>week ago or maybe a bit longer it only took one frame.  I put another
<br>frame in but don't know if any other pieces were there or not.  Took
<br>the images when the comet was low on E Horizion.  Gradients were a
<br>killer.  Thanks, Mike H.

Denis,
<br>
<br> You can get the elements of 73P "C" from
<br>http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/0073P/2006.html
<br>
<br>Added it my own copy of Guide 8.0 by typing in the elements. Your

<br>Hope to get a view of this comet this week. Tonight is looking good.

<br>That sure is a great question. I would have to think at this time , that if
<br>you place each comet as a sketch/CCDimage/ regular photo or a combination and
<br>include them with each having their separate data etc.I   would think that
<br>would be okay.I will consult others too.At this time, I   hear at least one of the
<br>pieces may be at least 7mag but who knows if this might change and who knows
<br>about   the other pieces. If so a great way to rack up your awards.

<br>> Hello…
<br>>
<br>>  I am seeing that around May 12-14, Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann, which
<br>> broke into several pieces, will pass near the earth and 3 of the brighter
<br>> pieces will be easily visible in telescopes.
<br>>
<br>>  My question, if I observe all 3 fragments, B, C and G, does this count as 1
<br>> observation for Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann or 3 observations, one for
<br>> each fragment?

Dennis.
<br>For Guide 8
<br>Go to create a "new comet" using edit comet data under the extras
<br>drop down box.  Scroll to the bottom for create "new comet".    Find
<br>the listing for 73P already in the comet list for a reference untill
<br>a couple of new comet comp. have been created
<br>
<br>P/Schwassmann-Wachmann (73P-B)   -   The B is just an example of how
<br>to list each new fragment changing the letter for a new piece of the
<br>comet.  Use the dates below changing for each piece.  Leave all other
<br>information the same for each piece.

Can you please confirm that K and S have the same perihelion date - as per your list below (Presumably one is in error?)

<br>  Dennis.
<br>  For Guide 8
<br>  Go to create a "new comet" using edit comet data under the extras
<br>  drop down box.  Scroll to the bottom for create "new comet".    Find
<br>  the listing for 73P already in the comet list for a reference untill
<br>  a couple of new comet comp. have been created
<br>
<br>  P/Schwassmann-Wachmann (73P-B)   -   The B is just an example of how
<br>  to list each new fragment changing the letter for a new piece of the
<br>  comet.  Use the dates below changing for each piece.  Leave all other
<br>  information the same for each piece.
<br>

Dave,
<br>
<br>the perihelion times are okay. I guess Mike took my list from my postings of
<br>comets-ml or the homepage. K and S are 0.001 days apart in perihelion time:
<br>
<br>from CBET 442:
<br>"Component S, of mag 20.9=21.5, has T only some 0.001 day earlier than component
<br>K, which has now been redetected at mag 20.9-21.3."
<br>
<br>When rounding to 2 digits one receives of course the same time.
<br>

Hello!

<br>While preparing my image setup for a later on imaging session an
<br>C2006 A1 Pojmanski, I used Arcturus for focusing. Then, while looking to
<br>"Cartes du Ciel" running on my laptop, I suddenly saw 73P only a stone's
<br>throw away from Arcturus. So I spontaneously decided to give 73P a try ...

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
As best I can tell from the CometObs site, fragments B and C have
<br>similar magnitudes. I tried looking on the NASA Recent Observations
<br>page which I used to use but that link no longer works.
<br>
<br>I just finished imaging B and am working on C as we speak/read.  I
<br>don't know how to do photometry but B certainly seems a lot brighter
<br>than C, and additionally sports a tail well over 50 arc minutes in
<br>length, whereas C has a short tail. Is B in outburst or is my eyeball
<br>estimate of magnitudes woefully poor?
<br>
<br>I'll post both images to my New Images page shortly (after I get some
<br>sleep, however).

Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3  was featured in the May
<br>Sky&Telescope and Astronomy magazines. I imaged fragments B and C
<br>last night. Fragment B was considerably brighter and had a beautiful
<br>tail over 35 arc minutes long. I have posted the B images on my web
<br>page linked below.
<br>
<br>I did not resolve the "plume" reported G. Sostero and E. Guido using
<br>simple stretching and isophote display techniques.

<br>
<br>Hi Dennis,
<br>apparently this feature was visible for a brief time. I'm pretty
<br>confident about its reality, since another author reported it
<br>indipendently, few hours before our observation:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/gpjqm
<br>
<br>On the other hand, on the images of Rolando Ligustri (March 4.86), as
<br>well as our images obtained on March 5.31, it is not visible anymore.
<br>
<br>In the cometary scientific literature, sometimes are reported similar
<br>structures (referred to as "coma arclets" or "coma wings") immediatly
<br>after a nuclear splitting. Since normally they are made of gases, are
<br>short living features.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

 Space Weather News for April 7, 2006
<br>http://spaceweather.com
<br>
<br>Dying comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 continues to break apart. Astronomers
<br>are tracking at least 20 fragments approaching Earth for a harmless but
<br>beautiful close encounter in May.
<br>
<br>In particular, fragment B of the comet has brightened 15-fold since April
<br>2nd. This signals a possible breakup of "73P-B" into even more fragments.
<br>Amateur astronomers with backyard telescopes and CCD cameras can monitor the ongoing
<br>disintegration.  Visit Spaceweather.com for sky maps, images more
<br>information.

A short thought to add.  I have piggybacked my ST2k CCD on the 4"

<br>have adaptors for your CCD's.  This also gives my CFW a chance to be
<br>used

Hello to all; just finished posting four images of the fragments 73P - B, C, G,
<br>and R on the ASO News Section website; morphological and physical observations
<br>are posted (http://www.arksky.org/ ) on the Comet Pages of the site.  Daily
<br>astrometric results on any fragments are posted daily on the site's Astrometry
<br>Tables link.
<br>
<br>The direct link to the images is:
<br>http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=980.msg4653#msg4653
<br>
<br>to the physical reports on the ASO Comet Tables:
<br>http://www.arksky.org/php/ctable.php
<br>(will be posted in about one hour)
<br>
<br>Details of CCD, field, etc. accompany the description of the four components.

Very Nice Mike,
<br>I too got out and spent hours visually observing these fragments. I did
<br>get a couple of drawings done. One of "B" and the other of "C", I need
<br>to them scanned and processed a bit, I should have them posted here
<br>tonight sometime. I think I was able to see component "G" but with the
<br>gibbous moon it was very difficult to confirm visually, your image says
<br>that I did see it. Thank you for posting them.
<br>My drawings are .50degree FOV, so your hope of wide-angle drawings will
<br>have to wait a couple of weeks until I can do some with the 5" F/5
<br>refractor and my 38mm Erfle (gives me 3.6 degrees FOV).

Before you open this I will appologize for the quality.  My flats
<br>didn't cut the mustard and Moon glow was a killer with the large
<br>images.  It does show about 4.4 deg of FOV with N up.  Images from
<br>about 0400UT 04062006.  Gives a perspective of distance with the pieces
<br>spreading out .  Once again if you use aol right click the image and
<br>reload full quality or distortion will destroy this picture.

<br>
<br>Have you directly measured it with a ruler or a balance?
<br>
<br>In short: a fragmentation doesn't automatically imply the *total* destruction of the nucleus.
<br>
<br>Longer version: fragment "B" of comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann has shown in the past week the typical behaviour of a fragmented comet: all the evidences (photometry, morpholoy, etc.) from a numer of observers pointed to it. In the last 24-36 hourse a sharp condensation toward the coma head is again visible: yesterday's images from various observers (T. Puckett, H. Mikuz, E. Guido and R. Ligustri just to cite some) clearly show the progressive enhancement of this detail. The explanation offered by a break-up event in the nucleus (and its consequences) fits quite well the events sequence (outburst of several magnitudes, disapparition of the central condensation, trailed aspect of the optocenter, flatness of the afrho, etc.).
<br>If now a central condensation is again visible, this likely means that we witnessed a *partial* break-up of the nucleus; may be worth to remind that a similar fact happened also to C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) some weeks before its *total* disgregation.
<br>What is missed up to now, is a direct imaging of the train of debris that was released after the partial split; but since these events happened with the interference of the moonlight, it was unlikely that any real big scope (the same class of instruments that were used to clearly show the C/1999 S4 demise) would be headed to the comet.
<br>
<br>However, IMHO fragment "B" has proved to be intrinsivally fragile, so the next few weeks could provide further opportunities to witness additional fragmentation events (partial or total), and then we will see if all of us were fooled by the "trailing star traces within the coma".
<br>

Thanks Giovanni; true that some morphological characteristics can suggest a breakup
<br>or massive outgassing of component B and it is possible that some fragmentation
<br>(physically observable might have been missed); in fact, Mike Holloway has taken
<br>our April 14 image of the central portion of "B" and enhanced it greatly to reveal
<br>a distinct "knot" some 13" arc from the strong nucleus in the direction of the tail
<br>(our measurement PA 225 degrees).  He suggested to me that it may indeed show a
<br>fairly large, albeit somewhat diffuse, fragment following the primary core of "B".

Excellent work and thanks for posting this Mike; indeed it looks like I may have
<br>missed a bit of fragmentation following in the path of component "B"; hopefully you
<br>or other good images will be able to pick up on the comet and get some low density

<br>
<br>Hi Tim,
<br>nice shots! It seems that a few arcsec South-West of the main condensation, there is a kind of diffused and elondated feature; in that point, it originates a kind of "widening" of the tail; may be a small cloud of debris, of some kind of sublimating feature?

Hmmm....if there is a demise of component "G", it did not show itself well over the
<br>skies of Arkansas this morning.
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBD7B7A4.jpg
<br>In fact, this component appears to be developing more rapidly morphologically than

<br>the coma's inner section is elongating similar to that of the "B" component.

<br>> I've been following 73P-B, C and G with the SAO 1.2-m almost nightly
<br>> for the past 11 nights.
<br>>
<br>> www.lpl.arizona.edu/~chergen/73P.html
<br>>
<br>> When comparing contour plots of the near-nucleus region of 73P-G over
<br>> the past week, it is apparent that G is not healthy. A sharp central
<br>> condensation observed on Apr. 12 and 13 UT is no longer visible.
<br>> Similar to 73P-B's appearance last week, G's central condensation is
<br>> elongated towards the anti-solar direction. The brightness of the
<br>> central condensation has also diminished over the past week.
<br>>
<br>> 73P-B still displays a "spine" of material trailing the nucleus in the
<br>>  anti-solar direction. Over the past 3 nights, the brightest part of
<br>> the spine has been detached from the nucleus by ~4-5". The appearance
<br>> of the "spine" has not changed much in the past few days. I believe it
<br>> is this spine and its local maximum in brightness that is being
<br>> identified as a secondary in recent images.

<br>Hi Mr. Clay,
<br>I have seen the image of this component and I have to say that it is impressive as he is
<br>increased in the last days.
<br>
<br>Considering that is smaller than the other components, I think that am possible that will
<br>be the first one to break up him!

I agree Rolando....while the other three of the "primary" components seem to be
<br>holding steady or progressing in a somewhat expected way, this one really appears
<br>to be quite active.  The "B" component is also one to keep our eyes on I believe.

<br>
<br>Slooh.com, an astronomical event Web site, said Tuesday it will begin live monitoring of the approach of Comet 73P
<br>Schwassmann-Wachmann, beginning this week at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.
<br>The comet, which has broken up into 19 separate pieces, is heading for a rendezvous with Earth. Slooh.com broadcasts live celestial
<br>events via its Web site from its telescopes stationed at high altitude at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands.
<br>
<br>The Web coverage will be hosted by astronomer David Levy, the co-discoverer of Comet Shoemaker-Levy; Bob Berman, a columnist for
<br>Astronomy Magazine; Michael Narlock, head of astronomy at the Cranbrook Institute of Science, and Jeffrey Bass, head of astronomy at
<br>the Milwaukee Public Museum.
<br>
<br>"We have assembled the equipment and the commentators for just such a spectacle," said Michael Paolucci, president of Slooh.com. "It
<br>will amaze people to see it live while the experts explain exactly what they are seeing."
<br>
<br>First discovered 76 years ago, Comet 73P Schwassmann-Wachmann split into 3 pieces in 1995 and, as a result, it grew brighter by
<br>three orders of magnitude.
<br>
<br>The brightest fragment "C" will zoom past Earth at a distance of 0.0735 Astronomical Units (11 million kilometers or about 7 million
<br>miles), and therefore does not threaten the planet. The other two main pieces may pass a little closer at 0.0515 AU and 0.0505 AU,
<br>respectively.
<br>
<br>Although rare, comet splits have been reported in the past, with the best-known case the comet Shoemaker Levy, which split into 21
<br>pieces before plowing into Jupiter in 1994.
<br>
<br>Launched in 2003 and with members in 60 countries, Slooh.com is the only live online telescope available to the public. Its
<br>patent-pending technology collects the light of distant celestial objects and streams it over the Internet in real time.
<br>
<br>Slooh.com's telescopes are configured to optimize the view of thousands of astronomical objects such as the Orion Nebula, the
<br>Whirlpool Galaxy and the Pleiades Cluster -- objects that are nearly impossible to see with backyard telescopes.
<br>
<br>The organization's telescopes are stationed five hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, which enables viewers in North America to see
<br>the night sky during daylight hours in the United States, starting as early as 2 p.m. Eastern Time.

Dear All,

<br>I have just grabbed a few images of this fragment, from Bellatrix
<br>astronomical Observatory, using a C11@f/7 and a SBIG ST-7XME camera;
<br>resulting scale is 0.9"/pixel: seeing was quite good. I managed to sum 8
<br>images, each integrated for 60 seconds. You can see it here:

Summary of a very active 73P, the four primary (brightest) components on April 22;
<br>note that all ASO images of 73P can be viewed on the Image Archives or under the
<br>Comets Table on the ASO home page; we have made an effort to obtain and archive all
<br>images at the exact same orientation, scale, density and optical characteristics
<br>for consistency.
<br>
<br>Components B and C are easily visible in smaller instruments and are ideally viewed
<br>in wide field, low power instruments; it is my suspicion that component "B" is
<br>become less visible in terms of total brightness due to its current fragmentation.
<br>
<br>Component C:
<br>Largest and brightest, with total mag. = 7.9 (102mm refr.); a very strong nucleus
<br>is now detected within a very dense elongated coma (m2=14.4ccd)
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBDCEE96.jpg
<br>
<br>Component B:  Now fragmented into two nearly equal components
<br>Showing the "B" components of Schwassmann-Wachmann 73P, now split into two nearly
<br>equal (15.4 and 16.0 ccd M1) magnitudes; inset showing a low saturation view of
<br>both components clearly with the "new" fragment in PA 230 degrees, 7.2" arc from
<br>the
<br>primary component.  NOTE: m1 of primary = 15.4 / secondary = 16.0 ccd
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBDCA160.jpg
<br>
<br>Component G:
<br>Component "G" of Schwassmann-Wachmann, in negative showing strong nuclear core
<br>(m2=17.4ccd), total mag. 14.4ccd; note the curving tail and some mottling within
<br>the nuclear core; astrometric measurements reveal a second fragment 5" in PA 213
<br>from primary.
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBDCF09D.jpg
<br>
<br>Component R:
<br>Component "R" of Schwassmann-Wachmann, showing weaknuclear core (m2=18.2ccd), total
<br>mag. ~19.0ccd; note the fanning weak tail in PA 215

At 0600UT on 04222006 the fragment was close to "chi Boo" - GSC 2030-
<br>1317 a magnitude 5.27 star.  This is a 7x40 sec stack on the stars with
<br>an inset stack on the comet and regenerated to show the at least two
<br>fragments of "B".  Guess if it were going to hit something they would
<br>be the Killer Bee's.  (small funny (very small).  I used a 4" FSQ
<br>refractor and FLI Maxcam 10 CCD Bin at 1x1.  I gave two links with the
<br>original and a smaller version as the standard.

Greetings.  This is a full mosaic with the 3 fragments.  It
<br>took a bunch of images, over 20 not counting the dozens of subframes,
<br>and a hardrive that wanted to give up a couple of times working with
<br>the almost 900mb to start.  Anyway this gives a perspective of the
<br>distance between fragments at a med. time of 0600ut - 04/22/2006.
<br>  At one time the working image was 9600 pix wide but publishing that
<br>was a problem so I reduced it to 2000 pix wide.

<br>Component "C" of Schwassmann-Wachmann 73-P; steady brightening now to 7.9 (visual,
<br>102mm refr.), without much development in terms of strength of tail; note the very

I measured a centroid-to-centroid spacing of the two nuclei of 16 +/-
<br> 2 arc seconds in 0330 UT 23 April images. I believe Doc Clay
<br>reported 12 arc seconds separation on the same night.
<br>
<br>For the first time ever I was able to guide on the head and take 6-
<br>minute subframes. The relative motion was 2.5 arc seconds per minute
<br>so guiding really helped me obtain a good SNR.

<br>In past attempts the autoguider would latch onto a star in the
<br>comet's path and get lost.  On my 23 April 0330 UT imaging session
<br>there were no stars brighter than magnitude 16 in the comet's path.
<br>That seldom occurs.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
An outstanding night of activity with comet 73P....each major (four) components has
<br>shown some incredible transformation.
<br>
<br>Component "B" of comet Schwassmann-Wachmann, showing a remarkable transformation of
<br>morphology between the nights of April 24 and April 27 (UT); note that the
<br>fragments of the comet "B", particularly the brighter fragment "aq" was not seen,
<br>even in high resolution imaging; no secondary fragments were found.  At this time
<br>component "B" rivals component "C" in brightness (8.3 and 7.9 m1 respectively)
<br>Component "B":
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBE38E24.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "C" of comet Schwassmann-Wachmann, showing a very pronounced coma with
<br>highly differentiated layers; note the inset which suggests that this fragment is
<br>still intact and Has NOT fragmented. Magnitude 7.9
<br>Component "C":
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBE39263.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "G" of comet Schwassmann-Wachmann, showing a strong indication of major
<br>fragmentation of the primary component; note the mottled appearance of the nebulous
<br>area following throughout the immediate tail area from the nucleus which is clearly
<br>offset slightly north and west from physical center.
<br>Component "G":
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBE39481.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "R" of comet Schwassmann-Wachmann, in a fairly substantial outburst over
<br>the past few evenings; the comet is now at mag. (m1) 14.1 ccd and has become far
<br>more concentration (5/9) since April 24

Hello Maciej...
<br>On April 24, only three nights ago, we measured component "R" at magnitude 17.4
<br>(m2, nuclear, via CCD); our physical description revealed it to be very obscure and
<br>faint with very little central condensation (3/9) and quite diffuse.  So this
<br>outburst is most definitely something that has happened only in the past couple of
<br>days.

<br>> checked motion I'm pretty confused... :0 The visual magnitude which I have
<br>>
<br>> is 14.2 mag. R was not visible on nights 26/25 and 25/24 when was fainter

<br>> than 14.5 (or even more).

Hello.  I agree with Rolando.  What can you say about the Hubble and
<br>other big scope images.  They are great!  I can't do what they do so I
<br>do what I do.
<br>  From the 27th 0650UT.  C is a bright comet and increasing.  This
<br>image covers about 1 x 1.5 deg. of sky and it appears that one frame
<br>will not cover the developing tail to the W and S in the next few

This is excellent work Mike; knowing your methodical and very particular and
<br>cautious way of post-processing, I am certain that you have shown certainly two
<br>fragments, possibly three or four, in the "C" component nucleus on this April 27
<br>image.  Hopefully others can obtain some high resolution images of this soon, but
<br>it appears that the US and much of the western world has inclement weather at the

WOW! Mike, nice job!! Now thats what I call a dynamic comet!!!
<br>We were out last night at 00:00 EDT and at 350x we thought we were
<br>seeing something going on in the nuclear area! I also noticed that the
<br>B component seemed to have settled down with an elongated central
<br>condensation. G component was almost not visible visually but the R
<br>component was a much easier visual object.
<br>Absolutely awesome image, Mike! Thank you for sharing!

<br>Note: The comet is near center. I do not know what the feature is on

<br>Rolando.  This image was not said to be anything more than false
<br>color added to a B&W image.  I did not want anyone to think this was
<br>true color.  Also I don't know why the center came out looking as it
<br>does.  It is a combination of 3 images stacked on the brightest pix
<br>of the comet head.  All 3 images were of the same quality and taken
<br>within a two minute time span.  Perhaps a star is behind the comet
<br>showing through,  I don't know.  The small bright area below the
<br>double center is also not known.  I allowed the computer to find and
<br>assighn colors to dim and bright levels.
<br>  It is always dangerous to claim anything without confirmation by
<br>others or taking another set of images which give the same results.
<br>I have not done because of heavy rain and T-Storms.  Let me show you
<br>another image taken on 4/18/2006 and never published of B.
<br>http://www.fototime.com/A89A6D4CE34435E/orig.jpg
<br>I suspected that Fragment B was in more than 2 pieces but dare not
<br>publish and probably should not now as I can only use the computer to
<br>show areas not pieces.  I was glad to see many fragments imaged by
<br>the large scopes and find a little satisfaction in my image as
<br>although skeptics will say they see nothing, and I respect there
<br>opinion, I did..
<br>  Getting back to C for a minute, why would it not be the next step
<br>for this fragment to come apart.  Is this not a part of the same
<br>comet and with almost everything else breaking up why would C be any
<br>different.  I hope it comes all to pieces and puts on the best show
<br>ever!  At the least, this C fragment shoud be sheading some big hunks
<br>of skin.
<br>  Your excellent images, Rolando, will in the future confirm what
<br>others suspect and the process of confirmation will continue to show
<br>or not show what is or is not there.  My skin is not to thick so I
<br>tend to be really conservative about what I publish.

Not much change overall in the four major components of 73P in the past two days.
<br>ASO Observations and measurements from this morning (April 30):  (astrometry posted
<br>under the Astrometry Pages link on home page, and physical details posted daily
<br>under Comet Tables)
<br>
<br>Component "C"
<br>A very bright component "C" with inset that possibly hints at some elongation or
<br>separation of the nuclear central mass; comet is mag. 7.3 visual, with m2-13.5ccd
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBE7AFE7.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "B"
<br>Now equally as bright as "C" this showing component "B" which has a somewhat more
<br>rounded coma (ellipse with "C");with inset showing that the "aq" secondary fragment
<br>has now greatly faded or disappeared.  Nucleus appears very much singular
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBE7B403.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "G"
<br>Component "G" is still weak, but nucleus shows a curious diffuse appearance,
<br>perhaps somewhat of an arc; comet was a bit brighter, Mag. 15.5 ccd, and the
<br>diameter measured at 20"
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBE7B6A2.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "R"
<br>Component "R" at magnitude 14.2 (ccd), with strong tail in PA 211 deg, m2=16.8ccd;
<br>note that the two faint objects in the anti-sun direction are 18th mag. field
<br>stars, not fragments

Dear All,

<br>I just uploaded an image of 73P, fragment B. It is the sum of 36 x 30
<br>seconds images, grabbed between 20:52 and 21:13 UT on Apr. 30.
<br>C11@f/7.3, CCD SBIG ST-7XME, scale 0.9"/pixel. North is up, East on the
<br>left. DDP scaling.
<br>
<br>The image is available here:

<br>http://www.bellatrixobservatory.org/73pb_060430.jpg
<br>
<br>Its aspect partly remembers me that observed on Apr. 19: a condensation
<br>is visible, followed by a more diffuse, but relatively bright zone,
<br>still providing a double-picked brightness profile.
<br>
<br>More date will be published later on.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I've added a short movie to my web page illustrating the rapid
<br>motion of 73P-B against the fixed star field.  It comprises 7 six-
<br>minute frames during which time the comet moves 1.8 arc minutes.
<br>
<br>Tips for comet movies:
<br>1) Crop around comet to keep file size small
<br>2) Align on stars, not comet, for smooth viewing
<br>3) Use minimum bit depth and lots of compression to keep file size
<br>small
<br>4) Throw out frames that do not follow a smooth comet motion
<br>
<br>I emphasize small file size because of late I've seen comet movies
<br>of 10-20 MB file size that would look just as good at 100 kB and
<br>would attract more viewers.
<br>
<br>Note: Mine is a dial-up-friendly movie. It is only 68 kB.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>Just finished a very fruitful session and this fragment looks, of course,

<br>
<br>As you can see here:

<br>
<br>there are at least two possible minor fragments there (oh, yes, nothing

<br>> Hi all,
<br>>
<br>> this image is just few minutes old and still shows a number of small
<br>> fragments around the main condensation. The latter is apparently undergoing
<br>> a major break-up, as evident from my images. I processed the current frame
<br>> to underline the small fragments, while a better view of the main
<br>> condensation (as well as a nhigh S/N of the present image) will follow.

Dear comet enthusiasts,
<br>
<br>I'm pleased to show the final version of my 73P-B images. The summarizing
<br>picture is available here:
<br>
<br>http://www.bellatrixobservatory.org/73pb_060505.jpg
<br>
<br>I added a number of details about my setup and imaging technique on the same
<br>picture, so I kindly invite those interested to check the image above.
<br>
<br>In brief, I used a short (20 sec) integration time, collecting up to 100
<br>frames to be added later on. I did the all the processing on that master
<br>frame, to assure the higher S/N. Scale is about 1"/pixel.
<br>
<br>Wishing you clear skies,
<br>Gianluca

Component "B" of Schwassmann-Wachmann3; note the duplicity of the nucleus
<br>(b=10.1ccd; b2 [aq?]=11.3ccd); two components were measured 7.2 arc seconds
<br>separation in PA 218 deg; tail in PA 224; coma is very elongated in tail angle and
<br>very compressed (DC=7/9)
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBEF03A8.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "C" of Schwassmann-Wachmann3; without a doubt the brightest of all 73P
<br>components; tail angle is changing (232 deg), while coma is very compressed and
<br>uniformly bright (m1=7.1 visual); note that coma is about twice as long (in tail
<br>angle) as it is wide at this point (1.2 x 2.3' ccd)
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBEF0540.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "R" of Schwassmann-Wachmann3; at total magnitude 16.4 (ccd) this
<br>component is fading rapidly within the past 7 days; tail is quite extended and can
<br>be traced on computer for 5.1' arc in PA 217 deg.  Very tenuous and diffuse without
<br>much central condensation...however, mottling in tail direction behind center of
<br>coma may indicate fragmentation
<br>http://www.arksky.org/asoimg/ComBEF06D6.jpg
<br>
<br>Component "G" at this time is very diffuse and quite difficult, with a nuclear mag.
<br>of 19.1 ccd; the coma is very tenuous and large without a good astrometric center;
<br>total magnitude estimated at 18.2, with very faint wide tail in PA 221 deg.

Hello to all....
<br>A quick reminder that in about one hour local time, Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3
<br>will be passing by the famous Ring Nebula (M57) in Lyra....so close that you will
<br>be able to view and/or photograph both in the same medium power field of
<br>view....this is an incredible once in a lifetime opportunity; the comet will be
<br>brighter than the Ring and appear somewhat brighter overall.  An extraordinary
<br>not-to-be-missed photo op.
<br>
<br>The constellation and objects will be very low in the northeast sky for this event,
<br>and close pass is between the hours of  3 and 4 UT (about 10-11 p.m. CDT).
<br>Observers in the eastern US are favored with the constellation somewhat higher in
<br>the sky at the time of closest pass.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
As I missed all previous meetings of comets the past years due to bad
<br>weather I was lucky today.
<br>I nearly spent the whole last night in my observatory, chasing  73P
<br>approaching M 57. Clouds rolled in from time to time, but cleared
<br>right in time.
<br>The awesome shot from Stefan showing the tiny fragments in B motivated
<br>me the first time to image a comet at my full f/10 setup (4m f/l).
<br>The comet moves very fast, so a guiding on the nucleus is essential
<br>and I used my TEC140 with the external STL guider and 200 sec
<br>subexposures at 2x2 bin.
<br>
<br>I invested 4000 sec for the L files to have an optimum S/N ratio and
<br>to get rid of the stars when using the median combine.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately no subfragments were visible even after applying all
<br>possible processing tricks. It seems that today even Stefan could not
<br>show them with his 0.9 m setup.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless I made seperate exposures of the M57 area before the
<br>comet reached this area. Then I blendedn the seperately processed
<br>comet with the Star field.
<br>
<br>The huge magnification makes the comet much bigger than it appears in
<br>visual mode, still I had fun with the processing:

A magnificent view of the "B" component of Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, showing two "bow
<br>arches" in the sunward direction of a very pronounced, singular nucleus
<br>(m2=9.9ccd); total magnitude (6.9) of the comet tonight is considerably brighter
<br>that just two nights ago and a very pronounced spike in PA 233 has developed; high
<br>resolution CCD imaging of the core of the comet reveals only a single bright
<br>nucleus.

<br>
<br>Fragment "C":  Still maintaining an elongated coma, uniformly bright (m1=7.3ccd),
<br>considerably smaller and less bright at this time than component "B"; long narrow
<br>tail; nucleus is singular in high resolution views.
<br>
<br>Both components are quite easily visible and nebulous in appearance in a standard 8
<br>x 50 telescope finder; the "B" component is spectacular in 10 x 50 binoculars in
<br>spite of strong moonlight to the west.

Component "B" of Schwassmann-Wachmann3, showing some diminishing of overall
<br>turbulent activity from the past week; however, the coma is still very interesting,
<br>being quite fanned or butterfly shaped as opposed to the remarkable "manta-ray"
<br>shape of May 9; note that the nucleus (m2-8.8ccd) is singular with no bright
<br>fragments trailing; spike (ion) tail in PA 233 has now seemingly vanished.  The
<br>comet is MAGNITUDE 4.7 overall at this time, about twice the intensity total as
<br>component "C"; the image at LEFT demonstrates the comet's overall size (coma) and
<br>brightness and is a single unprocessed 20-sec exposure; at RIGHT is an enhanced
<br>image, showing the delicate coma, quite uniform throughout, with the magnitude 8.8
<br>(ccd) nucleus evident, somewhat elongated.

<br> Component "C" of Schwassmann-Wachmann3, showing a very elongated, almost oblate

<br>(m2-10.1ccd) is singular with no bright fragments trailing;   The comet is
<br>MAGNITUDE 6.7 overall at this time, about half the intensity total as component "B"

The tail structure in the comet was there but very hard to bring out.

<br>unprocessed image.  I reduced from the original 2150 pix wide to 1200.
<br>Covers about 1.5 deg wide.  This is the full image.  Best thing to do

The following image of comet 73P Fragment B was taken
<br>this morning  using the CCDOps Track and Accumulate
<br>(TA) feature using a ST-2000XCM single shot color CCD.
<br>The program took 20 subframes of 15 second each, plus
<br>a dark frame too, and aligned them on the comet
<br>centroid and stacked them automatically.

<br>LRGB color image was created from the SBIG color image
<br>file using CCDSoft and then processed a little with
<br>Adobe Photoshop CS2 (curves, levels, layer masks,
<br>etc..)
<br>
<br>Thanks to the SBIG yahoo user who posted the recent
<br>comment about Track and Accumulate working with color
<br>one shot cameras!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>I can hardly believe how easy that was compared to the
<br>tedious manual way.
<br>
<br>The comet is so bright and moving so fast that this

<br>As earlier discussed,a sunward pointed jet is also visible well in the shorter exposed image(02:39 UTC).This looks a bit like an aniti-tail

Stefan.  The software I use to align and combine images (CCDSoft) has
<br>a magnifier or enlarger.  It is sometimes helpfull with the bright
<br>core of a comet to do an extreme histogram on the images to get rid
<br>of any excess brightness blead.  I then enlarge with the magnifing
<br>tool untill the brightest pix is showing in each image.  Select the
<br>bright pix or which ever looks to be the same pix in every image and
<br>do an align.  When you close these images they should revert to there
<br>original size.  Do a image combine to see if star trails are close to
<br>straight.  It is good to make duplicate files of the originals before
<br>starting so when you screw up you have the originals to go back to
<br>and preserve your work.  An automatic selector on a bright comet core
<br>will often select different areas and give the uneven star trails.
<br>Hope this can help.

Hello,
<br>
<br>My latest picture of  73P-B on 05-11 shows at least one jet pointed sunward.
<br>
<br>A second image the same night shows maybe a second jet. This image was
<br>exposed twice as long as the first one.
<br>
<br>I used the Larson-Sekanina filter to show the jets more clearly.
<br>
<br>As I am a newbie is this field, some question arises.
<br>
<br>Are there really two jets visible in my image?
<br>
<br>As I understand, the LS filter is a "dangerous" one to use.
<br>
<br>Is there some literature available on how to use the LS filter properly on
<br>comet images?
<br>
<br>If I have a good look on the monitor screen then there really seem to be two
<br>jets visible in the original (30x25s stacked) image.

<br>
<br>Hi Charles,
<br>it is a special image processing tool prepared by Martino Nicolini (Cavezzo Observatory) for the CARA collaboration (http://cara.uai.it).
<br>
<br>As you commented, it creates a "virtual" coma that obeys the 1/r theoretical photometric profile produced by the dust distribution (the brightest pixel in the optocenter is used as starting value for the rest of the the calculations). This virtual coma is then subtracted from the actual image; in this way any departure from the theoretical 1/r coma profile is enhanced (tails, jets, arclets, etc.).
<br>
<br>Another software we use within the CARA for comae studies, is the common rotational gradient filtering (also known as "Larson-Sekanina"), and the Azimuthal Median Subtraction (also commented in Comets II) where you build up a synthetic coma averaging the real one through a series of consecutive annulus starting from the optocenter.
<br>
<br>It must be said that the interpretation of the details obtained with these techniques are not always straightforward, and some cross-check analysis among the different image processing packages is needed, in order to decrease the probability of misinterpretations. Obviusly these softwares are supposed to work with images where the S/N is as high as possible.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hi. This image shows some hint of the jet on the B fragment.  It was
<br>taken in the early hours of May 12, using an SC3 modified webcam on
<br>LX200 10" at f/7.  Sum of 254 x 3 sec exposures.
<br>
<br>http://universalconstant.com/73P-B_20060512.07.jpg
<br>
<br>In fact, these multiple short exposures were taken by my auto-guider
<br>camera whilst I was actually imaging with a piggy-backed 80mm f/5
<br>refractor.  It just seemed a shame not to save and use the guide cam.
<br>shots too :-)
<br>
<br>If you're interested, here is a DivX animation of the shots taken with
<br>the 'real' imaging scope.  It covers approximately 80 minutes of the
<br>comet's passage through Cygnus.
<br>
<br>WARNING: Large file (930 KB), and you will need a DivX codec to view it:
<br>http://universalconstant.com/73P-B_12May2006_0140-0259UT.avi
<br>
<br>The animation is 135 x 30 sec exposures taken with an Artemis-285
<br>camera, 2x2 binning, and 80mm f/5 achromat.  The frame is approximately
<br>one degree wide. The bright star towards the top of the frame is 19
<br>Cyg. (magnitude 5) and the faintest stars visible are approx. magnitude
<br>13-14.  The brightening of frames towards the end of the animation is
<br>due to the first glimmers of dawn light, but exaggerated by the fixed
<br>histogram stretch I applied to every frame.

Hello!
<br>At http://www.filelodge.com/files/room26/719805/sw3b.gif you can see
<br>an animation with comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 B. The animation is
<br>composed of individual frames shot on friday night with a Canon EOS
<br>Digital Rebel and a celestron C9.25 with f/6.3 reducer.
<br>The movie shows the movement of the comet during 24 minutes.

To the observers,
<br>
<br>Fragment B has indeed splitted again recently,this seeing-selected frame from May 15 shows what I already
<br>suspected during imaging.It was only visible well in the good moments,as the components were still very
<br>close.

Could the shape of fragment C possibly be interpreted

Stefan.  Thank you.  Looking at my last attempt at this comet, my
<br>star aleign is not so good due to high clouds making starpoints
<br>bload .  I can only tell you my way of manual aleign and bet others
<br>have different and better ways.
<br>  I use the software CCDSoftV5.  After aquiring images in the FITS
<br>format and applying dark and flats, each images has a strong
<br>histrogram applied which will reduce any overblead in the core area.
<br>I then use the zoom or magnify tool to zoom in on the core of the
<br>comet until it pixelates and shows a bright point.  Bad seeing will
<br>make this vary so the better the seeing of course the better the
<br>outcome.  Select the same area with the aleign tool with a manual
<br>select (CCDSoft has "CTRL-ENTER" to overide auto-select) and do an
<br>aleign on the pixel I want in each image.  When I close the images
<br>they revert to the original size.  Combine and make corrections if
<br>possible.  Be sure to save a duplicate set of original files for
<br>backup before starting.  Combining in an add, average and median are
<br>always performed to have different possibilities and bring out
<br>different structures in the tail.  After combining in the fits format
<br>I save the images in TIFF format for transfer to PS for the next step
<br>of processing.  Final images are then saved as tiff and a copy is
<br>saved as jpeg for publishing.  One more thing, I apply the histogram
<br>to the fits image after combine to once again reduce the core blead
<br>and give a nice image to start with in PS as a TIFF image.  Hope this
<br>helps if you can follow my instructions.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Mike, I use K3CCDTools to align images on the comet's head.  I use a
<br>2-stage process at x2 up-sample to get accurate alignment using
<br>the 'view difference' function. Then down-sample back to normal size
<br>at the end.
<br>
<br>Here is an example of an animation of 73/P-B that I made from 135 x
<br>30 sec images aligned this way:  (warning: large DivX file 1.1MB)
<br>
<br>http://universalconstant.com/73P-B_12May2006_0140-0259UT_ff.avi
<br>
<br>One issue I found with getting exact alignment of frames: if you auto-
<br>guided on the comet during image capture, over a period of say 60
<br>minutes, there is some slight field rotation with respect to the
<br>background stars!  If you look closely at the above AVI (covering 80
<br>minutes of movement of the comet) you can just detect the rotation as
<br>the frames progress.

Comet 41P Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak has a history of rapid brightening
<br>pre-perihelion. It was rather bright at its last two apparitions,
<br>and at its 1973 apparition underwent two large outbursts of 9-10
<br>magnitudes peaking at magnitude 4-5. Comet 41P is expected to reach
<br>magnitude 10 around perihelion on June 11, but in light of above may
<br>well be brighter. It passes from Cancer into Leo in early June and
<br>spends the rest of the month in this constellation.
<br>
<br>The comet was moving at a relative rate of 2.2 arc seconds per
<br>minute on May 23rd.  I imaged it at 5.0 arc seconds per pixel,
<br>binned 2x2, which allowed two minute exposures without blurring the
<br>comet. Actually, with the comet fairly low in the west against the
<br>setting sun, I started with 60 second exposures to avoid saturation.
<br>
<br>My sky conditions were 20.30 mags/sq arc second at zenith ~ Bortle
<br>4.5 ~ 5.6-5.9 VLM as measured with the Sky Quality Meter; seeing ~

Hi all,
<br>
<br>The latest processed data from my 2006/05/05 imaging session on 73P-SW-component B shows
<br>that there must have been a splitting into again 4 large pieces,see attached.
<br>This image was the one with best resolution of that session.

Hello Dennis.  Appreciate the image of this comet.  I guess you saw
<br>where there will be a nice approach of this one in 2017.  I think I
<br>will just run right out tonight and set up so I will be ready for it.

Hi Dennis,
<br>
<br>At first I think this is a question of personal taste.
<br>The professional observatories use often the comet-aligned method.
<br>
<br>I first made movies aligned on the stars,but I turned to this
<br>kind,because you have a better eye on the comet,when it keeps
<br>at one point in the field.I discovered this,when I made a movie
<br>of P/SW-3 fragment B with a small mini-fragment.This kind of small
<br>detail is not visible well when it moves,for this movie see:

Hi Rolf,
<br>
<br>I like the two animations you posted now. They depict smooth motion,
<br>whereas the previous one seemed a bit bumpier.
<br>
<br>I used to align on the comet, thinking that it was a good way of
<br>revealing changes in the tail structure during the course of the
<br>animation. I have since concluded that somehow the background level
<br>changes from one frame to the next, which has the effect of
<br>revealing more or less tail structure, but no actual changes. I'm
<br>not sure why the background varies, even during clear, steady skies,
<br>but I always seem to have a few frames that are different.
<br>
<br>Clear skies,

Hi Dennis,
<br>
<br>This bumping was caused by the fact that the movie is created of
<br>images from 3 nights! So the stars are not the same,and the camera
<br>position has possibly changed a bit.But I think it was an
<br>interesting experiment to make a movie of several days.This is also
<br>the reason why it is unpossible to make a star-aligned movie of it,
<br>because the stretch of the comet is too large during that time to
<br>show in one image-animation.Aligning on the comet was the only
<br>solution here.

Dennis,about this:
<br>
<br>''but I always seem to have a few frames that are different.''
<br>You can correct every frame on same brightness level before convert
<br>in into GIF.You can do that simply by moving the next layer a bit
<br>from its place,until you see the greytones of both layers.Then
<br>corret the brightness until you get the same greytone.

<br>Hi,
<br>
<br>My image ( 06-16) of C/2004 B1 (LINEAR) shows a tail of about 14' :

<br>I was not sure if the tail was real, so I also took a picture on 06-17, on that picture there was no sign of the tail at all.
<br>The observing conditions on 06-17 were a bit more humid then the previous night.

<br>
<br>Hi Klaas,
<br>we faced the same problem: shooting at this comet with less than perfect skies, blows out its faint appendage. The signal originated by the tail is very close to the sky background, so any kind of light pollution and/or haze will hamper its visibility.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

<br>very nice image of comet 41P! I possibly see evidence of two elongation in the coma, that are also visible in the shoots took by Ernesto on 2006, June 17 from the NM Skies site: a narrow one, is almost 1.2' long in PA 94 deg, while the other (much wider and faint) is almost 0.7' in PA 290 deg.

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>The exposure time of 71P is the same as 2006 L2, that is 15x10 seconds.
<br>However, 71P was imaged at lower elevation over city light pollution whilst
<br>2006 L2 was directly overhead, hence it's difficult to make a comparison.
<br>Have not had the opportunity yet to observe 2006 L2 visually from a dark
<br>site.
<br>

Hi Klaas/Giovanni,
<br>
<br>I agree.I work under the light poluted Dutch skys,and I only could
<br>bring out the brightest part of the tail on June 17.The sky was
<br>clear though:

<br>by the tail is very close to the sky background, so any kind of
<br>light pollution and/or haze will hamper its visibility.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
During the past three very deep nights, we have been tracking Machholz
<br>(C/2004 Q2); I would like to get some feedback from anyone else who might
<br>have been imaging (high resolution) or recording this object as it appears
<br>incredibly delineated or perhaps even segmented in a NE-SW orientation.  At
<br>first I assumed that this might be a result of proper motion, but tracking
<br>over 2-3 minutes on the comet itself is resulting in the same narrow streak
<br>surrounded by a very faint coma; if it is indeed separated, it is slightly
<br>beyond the resolution of our 0.41m RC.
<br>
<br>Thanks for any assistance on this.

Hi Mike,
<br>thanks for your mail; you raised an interesting question.
<br>If we look at the orbital circumstances of this passage, we can notice the following facts:
<br>
<br>2006, Jun. 30 (current situation)
<br>distance from Earth: ~0.44 AU; distance from the Sun: ~1.44 AU
<br>
<br>2006, Jul. 19 (perigee)
<br>distance from Earth: ~0.36 AU; distance from the Sun: ~1.28 AU
<br>
<br>2006, Aug. 28 (perihelium)
<br>distance from Earth: ~0.51 AU; distance from the Sun: ~1.10 AU
<br>
<br>So, in the next couple of weeks, the comet will slightly decrease its distance from Earth, then it will get a little farther away from us at the time of perihelium. Looking at this numbers, I suspect that this circumstances should not affect too much the visibility of details like the faint (but huge) external coma that made the difference at the time of 2P/Encke previous passage you mentioned. About the latter: I understand that at least one observer has recently reported the CCD detection of a faint & extended coma in comet Barbard. The images obtained by E. Guido and myself doesn't show this detail: we can we see just a small (~12") compact coma. However it's plenty possible that the observing conditions (sensitivity od the instrumentation, hight above horizon of the target, crowded star fields, etc.) could have hamperred our detection  of this fine detail. For this reason, any additional imaging by other fellow comet observers would be very valuable in order to clarify the situation.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

Hi all,
<br>
<br>When I grabbed the first frames of comet Linear on july 3, I was
<br>surprised to see not 1 but 3 spots with a cometary appearance.
<br>After some minutes,it was clear that one of these is was the
<br>comet,and the other faint galaxies of the same brightness.
<br>The movie shows how this comet C/2004 B1 passes these galaxies in

<br>According to the latest downloaded data,the brightness of the comet

<br>I just looked at this

<br>image from Norbert. Its phantastic to see the dim green coma. But secondly I
<br>noticed at once the trail in the lower left. It has another direction as the rest! It's
<br>the minor planet (532) Herculina with mag 9.5. North is up and east to the right.
<br>
<br>This was the technic of Eric Elst, who discovered hundreds of MPs on Schmidt
<br>Plates at La Silla. He made multiple exposures on the same plate and moved the
<br>plate in declination each time. All dots which weren't aligned north-south were
<br>MPs. He told me this when I met him at Hoher List (Bonn University
<br>Observatory, MPC 017) some years ago.

Yes - pleasingly close. (whew!) Actually, the real reason for the accuracy must
<br>be attributed to the accuracy of your pre-discovery image measurement.
<br>Congratulations.
<br>
<br>In broad terms the ephemeris I sent yesterday remains a good indication for this
<br>comet. I think the main problem with visibility of this comet is that while it
<br>gets a reasonable solar elongation, it will be largely north of the sun, rather
<br>than east or west. As a result, the better views will be had by those living in
<br>high northern latitudes....
<br>
<br>As a post-script (and thinking of C/2006 A1 Pojmanski), I hope we don't have
<br>wishful thinkers suggesting that this comet is going brighten to be a
<br>spectacular comet...... It clearly will brighten significantly from the present,
<br>and we can assume the tail will grow significantly as it gets closer to the sun.
<br>But there is currently no reason to expect anything more than this. I think we
<br>can also assume that there will only be a small number of observations reported
<br>prior to it being lost in the twilight at around the end of July/early August.
<br>It will be interesting to see who is the first to see it as it comes away from
<br>the Sun in late September.... [This is a challenge.... - with the 'prize' being
<br>the _glory_ of being the first to see it past solar conjunction.]

Giovanni,
<br>
<br>    The previous night I was observing the rapid motion of 177P/Barnard
<br>( visual m1 = 10.8, coma=3.5' ) from Spain, at the same time of your
<br>image ( 16.92 to 16.97 UT ), among the same stars. After coming back
<br>home, I follow the link to the beautiful image ... Thanks por posting
<br>it.
<br>
<br>    Best wishes for the summer and clear skies,

I've just sent some positions of this comet to the MPC. It is hard for me to get
<br>a decent image - the window for when it is dark enough to get an image, and when
<br>it disappears behind a tree (& then my observatory wall) is currently only about
<br>15 mins.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I plugged the positions from M.P.E.C. 2006-N38, plus my two positions of
<br>tonite, into Orbfit. There is a significant change in the elements, which I now
<br>get (with an RMS of 0.66"):
<br>
<br> T 2006 Sep 26.642
<br> q = 0.6600
<br> e = 1
<br>Peri  71.167
<br>Node 148.855
<br>Incl 113.352
<br>
<br>The significant change in perihelion distance means the comet will be brighter
<br>than previously anticipated. Given this, I will be particularly interested in
<br>the orbit that the MPC comes up with.
<br>
<br>An indicative ephemeris based on these elements follows. Note that compared to
<br>the previous ephemeris, the position is different by about 8 deg at the
<br>beginning of October, and 25 deg at the end of October ... This clearly
<br>illustrates the fact that the orbit is still not well defined, so the position
<br>and behaviour in October is at best 'indicative'.

Hi Juan José,
<br>nice coincidence!
<br>
<br>Yesterday night we imaged it again; the external coma of this comet now
<br>appears to be elongated (major axis aligned toward South), but we don't
<br>know if this is a spurious effect of the background stars within the
<br>coma. Do you, or any other observer/imager in [Comet-Images], noticed
<br>anything like this?

Well, the orbit below is wrong...... Oops - how embarrassing!.
<br>
<br>It turns out that I didn't use Orbfit properly to get the solution..... didn't
<br>press the right button. [Annoying that when you load an observation file into
<br>Orbfit it presents an immediate result which look like a valid solution having
<br>good RMS residuals - and yet that solution can be totally invalid]. Anyway the
<br>orbit on  M.P.E.C. 2006-N38 is good, with the perihelion distance reducing by
<br>perhaps 0.01 units. Expect an MPEC update at the end of the week.... But my

There does appear to be a bit of elongation to both the nucleus and the
<br>inner portions of the coma; note that the proper motion of 177P is now quite
<br>rapid and longer exposures (even on the order of 45 seconds) are resulting
<br>in nuclear elongation.  We detected what might be a slight sunward extension
<br>this morning and well as some slight indication of tail separation, in spite

<br>
<br>Hi dr.Clay,
<br>thanks for your answer and image. I agree: the high proper motion (~4.1"/min) of this comet is a real problem: for this reason we were forced to  stack a number (60) of short exposures (30 seconds each) shots, with a scope having a scale of ~2.5 arcsec/px. This resulted in a perfectly starlike central condensation.
<br>
<br>What we (possibly) noticed is an elongation of the outer coma (say, ~3 arcmin radius from the central condensation). However this detail is just at the threshold limit stacking 60 exposures of 30 seconds, and possibly influenced by the luminosity of some backgroud stars.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

Hi all,
<br>
<br>I imaged newly discovered comet C/2006 M4 (SWAN) last Saturday night (22.27 July - UT) The image was taken through my 16" (41cm) f4.5 Newt with a Canon 10D DSLR camera. The cropped FOV is about 30' x 20'. I only had time to image 16 x 45 second exposures before rushing off to watch the All Blacks play South Africa in rugby. The comet was very low in the west (about 10 degrees up).

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Comet 177P Barnard is currently magnitude 8.4.  I imaged it last
<br>night and thought I'd visually observe it and post an "eyepiece
<br>view" image beside the camera image.  But as carefully as I searched
<br>the sky with my 14-inch SCT I could not see it!
<br>
<br>Now I can assuredly see magnitude 8.4 stars with my 14-inch scope
<br>from my VLM 5.6 site,  so why couldn't I see the comet?  The camera
<br>of course saw it with ease on the six-inch astrograph.

<br>all there  and let me know what went wrong.

I have had two reports of this anomaly from the 28th from fairly experienced

<br>today and said what he observed on the night of July 28 was not recorded on

The first image is quite convincing. The stacking results in the comet being

<br>The 2nd image (of C/2006 M1)is less convincing. Because it is a single exposure,

<br>
<br>Hi Dave,
<br>in principle, I would have agreed with you.
<br>However there are a number of reasons that convince me about the correct identification of this object:
<br>1) indeed, it does have a tail; see:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/emgst
<br>2) it has a FWHM of 5.1" (field stars of comaprable magnitude have 4")
<br>3) its S/N is above 9 (ulikely to be noise)
<br>4) there is no counterpart in POSS catalogue in this position
<br>5) its measured astrometric position lies within A.R.= 0.03s, Decl.= 0.15" from its predicted position.
<br>
<br>Anyway, if these reasons are not enough for you, let's wait and see the astrometric residuals of our frame (we submit it to the MPC) in the next MPEC obital update of this comet.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

I guess there is an important point of difference...
<br>
<br>When I report astrometry of faint moving objects, I _always_ make sure that I
<br>can detect motion before I report a position. The fact that you have identified
<br>an object at the 'predicted' position means no more than there is an object at
<br>that location. To be sure that its the comet (and not a star or small galaxy),
<br>you really need to be able to demonstrate motion. Note that a reported position
<br>that is in accordance with the ephemeris will have acceptable residuals by
<br>definition... - so that the MPC residual is of no guidance. Indeed, if you
<br>happen to measure a star rather than the comet, the data will have a corrupting
<br>impact on the MPC database! In this regard I'm sure the MPC operates on the
<br>basis that the observer has good reason to believe that the object is the
<br>particular object in question - and coincidence with the predicted place is (in
<br>itself) a very poor determinative.
<br>
<br>Oh - and I'm not convinced from your image about the tail. The faint elongation
<br>could be caused by a faint background star - there are plenty of similar
<br>markings in your image.
<br>
<br>I should note that occasionally some observers don't report positions if the
<br>residuals from the MPC orbit are significant - in an erroneous belief that their
<br>observations might be wrong in some manner. This is the 'other side of the coin'
<br>on the issue of coincidence of position with prediction. If you are sure that
<br>the object you are measuring is the object in question, the size of the
<br>residuals should not be relevant to whether or not you report the position. And
<br>if you filter observations to those having a small residual - you will finish up
<br>with a biased set of observations, and the orbit fit will be similarly biased
<br>(and therefore erroneous). Similarly reporting observations of objects that
<br>happen to be at the predicted location (with no other basis for identifying them
<br>as the object in question) merely biases the observations data set to positions
<br>that closely match the previously determined orbit, and not the actual object.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, the way I see the situation is that you have a number of reasons
<br>to believe that you _may_ have imaged the comet (and I would agree that this is
<br>_likely_). But your one image is insufficient to establish that in fact you have
<br>imaged the comet, and not something else. It really is a pity that you only have
<br>the one image. And I would STRONGLY urge you to report positions of faint comets
<br>only when you can demonstrate motion (or _clear_ cometary features).

<br>> The first image is quite convincing. The stacking results in the comet being
<br>> circular, and the stars trailed.
<br>>
<br>> The 2nd image (of C/2006 M1)is less convincing. Because it is a single
<br>> exposure,
<br>> and (at least from what I can see on the image) there is no evident coma or
<br>> tail, this is (at least in my mind) a case of there being an object in the
<br>> expected position of the comet. When I do astrometry on such objects, I ALWAYS
<br>> make sure I have positions at two different epochs (at least) so that the
<br>> identification is confirmed by the motion. From that one image there is no
<br>> reason for concluding that the identified object is the comet.
<br>
<br>Hi Dave,
<br>in principle, I would have agreed with you.
<br>However there are a number of reasons that convince me about the correct
<br>identification of this object:
<br>1) indeed, it does have a tail; see:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/emgst
<br>2) it has a FWHM of 5.1" (field stars of comaprable magnitude have 4")
<br>3) its S/N is above 9 (ulikely to be noise)
<br>4) there is no counterpart in POSS catalogue in this position
<br>5) its measured astrometric position lies within A.R.= 0.03s, Decl.= 0.15" from
<br>its predicted position.
<br>
<br>Anyway, if these reasons are not enough for you, let's wait and see the
<br>astrometric residuals of our frame (we submit it to the MPC) in the next MPEC
<br>obital update of this comet.

Dave,
<br>I agree about the fact that all the points you listed (in particular the multiple exposures) is the rigorous procedure one must follow. And, incidently, this is what I normally do when imaging or measuring a comet (in this particular case, I used a single exposure because the others were ruined by some passing clouds). All in all, I'm pretty confident about its identification, for the reasons I listed previously. Yes, on a rigorous basys, this is not correct, and you are right. However, IMHO, all the hypothesis you need to find out to explain differently what in my picture is labelled as "C/2006 M1" (something that occupies the proper position and is not present in the POSS, with a good S/N, a nice comet-looking FWHM, does have a small tale, etc.) are less likely than the comet hypothesys itself.
<br>
<br>And, to be ultimately rigorous, even the multiple exposure procedure is not enough. Actually you must go there and land on the comet to be absolutely sure about what you measured, since you can always be fooled by a passing asteroid that, during such particular time span, was moving along a path that simulates the comet's motion...
<br>

<br>Giovanni

Comet 177P is moving at a relative speed of 3.6 arc seconds per
<br>minute against the star field in Hercules. This makes it difficult
<br>to image as one must take short exposures so the comet is not
<br>blurred  and autoguiding on a comet is very difficult.
<br>
<br>But the good news is that the fast-moving comets make for nice
<br>movies.  I've put a short, modem-friendly 432 kb movie that shows
<br>seven arc minutes of travel from 59 minutes of subframes.

Hi Mike,
<br>I'm sad to read about these bad news; I hope that you will be able to recover soon from this disaster, so we will be able to enjoy again your beautiful images.
<br>
<br>We had a similar misfortune few years ago at our observatory, in Remanzacco: all the PCs, CCD, etc. were switched off and unplugged from the power live, *however* the internet cable was still plugged in. We get a lightening from the phone line, that fried our go-to telescope electronics, the PCs and the CCD...

Dear Mike,

<br>    I too am very sorry for the damage in your observatory. But human life
<br>is the most important consideration. As you say, the lightning would have
<br>killed anyone working there.
<br>    Thirty years ago, I was involved in a long and hard mountain rescue of

<br>rescue carried out in snow and cold conditions. I have been involved in
<br>very different mountain and cave rescues for a very long time, but I will

Mike,
<br>
<br>Ouch!  No doubt about what happened there!  Sorry to hear about the
<br>damage.  Even in southern California we've been getting a lot of
<br>thunderstorms with a spectacular show a couple of weeks ago at my
<br>club's site:
<br>
<br>  http://www.eanet.com/kodama/nature/2006/0722a/index.htm
<br>
<br>During this storm, even though the lightning itself was an estimated 5
<br>miles away at its closest, I personally saw a fence a few hundred feet
<br>away light up as if it were a rope of fluorescent light bulb.  Now I
<br>always unplug all of my equipment power and signal cables on *both* ends.
<br>
<br>Fortunately this storm skirted our site, but after several years of
<br>enduring failures of our hard-wired LAN switches across our site, we
<br>finally switched to fiber optics and so far we're OK this year.

<br>you can find an image of this new comet.
<br>Doing elaborate the image I have noticed that there is a strange structure (a tail?) in PA

<br>
<br>Some changes in the calculated position of my suspected comet can be substantial if the

<br>getting a good astrometric center for this object was very difficult due to its large

<br>be off as much as 2.5 to 3.0 minutes because of questionable centroid locations.  What

Comet 177P Barnard is currently magnitude 8.5.  Your planetarium
<br>program probably says its 13.8, but that's wrong. The comet is
<br>presently much brighter than the standard  light curve predicts.
<br>
<br>But it is a very diffuse blob, and pretty difficult to observe
<br>visually.  Observers and  imagers in North America will find it
<br>positioned nicely in Hercules. It transits in the early hours of
<br>astronomical darkness.  It is an excellent imaging target with a ten
<br>arc minute coma.  Alas, it has no tail.

Hi all,
<br>yesterday night we made a pretty long series of exposures about P/2006 HR30 (Siding Spring). According to our data, there are no new features visible on this comet, as recentrly claimed by one observer, but probably the evolution of those structures already mentioned in this mailing-list on August 5 and 6 by seberal observers, like (e.g.) Peter and Rafael.
<br>
<br>In detail:
<br>1) we have evidence of an extension toward PA354 deg, almost 0.4 arcmin long; an image is available here:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/rweaw
<br>
<br>2) a diffuse and sightly bent tail, some 2 arcmin long, toward PA 205 deg; an enhanced image is available here:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/zubqu
<br>
<br>Position and morphology of these features seems to correspond to those mentioned previously in mail nr. #10383, nr. #10390 (and subsequents) of this mailing-list.

I made a small (243 kB) movie of 177P Barnard traversing 5 arc
<br>minutes of sky.  In all of my movies I usually see a bit of jitter
<br>from frame-to-frame.  I finally think I know the source of the
<br>jitter I think it's seeing.  My seeing for the movie was poor,
<br>about Pickering 3 or 4 arc seconds or so FWHM.  This is typical for
<br>the Midwest USA.
<br>
<br>If you look at the movie you will see the PSF of stars changing from
<br>one frame to the next. It is easiest to see on the faintest stars.
<br>The image scale is 2.5 arc seconds per pixel, re-sampled from 5.0
<br>arc seconds per pixel in the original 2x2 binning.
<br>
<br>Each frame is a four minute exposure, and I'd have thought that
<br>seeing effects would average out during this long a period, but I
<br>still think seeing is the predominant effect.  I'd appreciate
<br>comments from others on the root cause.

<br>
<br>Hi Dennis,
<br>IMHO this tail is an evolution of what was already visible on several deep shots obtained at the beginning of August: in particular I'm reffering to the images of Rafael Ferrando and Peter Birtwhistle:
<br>
<br>http://tinyurl.com/hbmeb
<br>http://tinyurl.com/en4q8
<br>
<br>It looks like that the comet is evolving quickly, in spite of the coma aspect (still almost stellar in amateur's images).
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

<br>
<br>Hi Mike,
<br>thanks for your comment. Yes, indeed this doesn't seem a comet, unless you increase the stretching parameters to show the faint outer coma and/or you check for its astrometry, comparing the field with the POSS survey.
<br>
<br>It's an odd comet, that produces an almost starlike central condensation when it's experiencing in active phase, like during these days.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

I keep thinking the name is Sliding Spring, but the observatory in
<br>Australia is in fact Siding Spring.
<br>
<br>This 13.4 magnitude  comet(?),was formerly designated an asteroid.  In
<br>my  45 minute image it sure looks more like an asteroid than a comet.
<br>I was unable to capture any hint of a tail as others have.

<br>
<br>Hi Dennis,
<br>in the image obtained from the Remanzacco Observatory on 2006, August 31.81 (i.e. almost 8 hours before your shot) the faint tail toward South-West is just a hint even on the negative and false colors palette, while the diffuse detail toward North is visible with higher contrast:
<br>
<br>http://tinyurl.com/o6xuv
<br>
<br>It's plenty possible that it's vanishing; another possibility is due to its extremely low contrast, so if you don't match the appropriate sky conditions, you are prevented to evidence it: sometime we cannot see it as well, albeit we use the same instrumentation that showed it up readily just the night before.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

Greetings. There are two images posted in the same file showing
<br>progress on a home made lightning protection for a rotating dome.
<br>How to get to the center or close and still be able to rotate the
<br>observatory. This is not finished but for $134.00 and about 1 hour
<br>of my time I feel this will help although if lightning wants you it
<br>will get you. The images show the observatory which was designed
<br>from the ground up to handle a fiberglass dome and a 12x12 office.
<br>Power is not to the building yet and I need to trim the grass. If
<br>you have any ideas to add to this project please tell me as this is
<br>not finished. I would sudgest that anyone like myself that has an
<br>observatory with no trees or structures to divert a strike consider
<br>some kind of protection.
<br>I am sorry for this off topic but if I can help one other person it
<br>would be worth it. I have new equiptment on order now and will be
<br>moving to a 5" Televue 127is 660mm @ F5.2 without a FR and F4.6? 530mm
<br>with it. Also a bigger go-to mount to handle the added size. I was
<br>not going to put the new equiptment up untill changes were made to
<br>help protect from another lightning strike.
<br>Thanks, Mike H.

<br>In

<br>comet.

<br>
<br>Now also on our images (total exposure time ~1 hour) the tail isn't

<br>comet swan was 9-10° above horizon. i had no perfect sky  - faintest

<br>Hi Ralf,
<br>our images obtaind almost simultaneusly, doesn't show the detail you mentioned. What we can readily see on the imaging we made on two separate nights, is a clear asimmetry of the coma (visible also on your images) likely due to the presence of a fan-like feature developing clockwise in N-E direction:

<br>The scale of the image is almost 0.9"/px, the FWHM of the fields stars was close to 2"

In your last image,

<br>
<br>Why are there are no elongated stars (trails)??
<br>
<br>TheSky6 shows for Chiron:
<br>RA rate (arcsecs/sec): -0.0008

<br>
<br>that is SQRT(X^2 + y^2) = 0.001064 (arcsecs/sec for

<br>
<br>The problem is that at the time of our exposure, the seeing was awful, and object ~25 deg above the horizon. To make it short, the FWHM of the field stars is ~6.5 arcsec and, actually, you can notice that they looks like defocused: it's not a real defocusing, but the effect of the bad seeing!

I should have stayed up to 3:30 am to get the comet near transit but I
<br>was too tired. I managed to capture a 10 arc minute long tail. This is

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hi,
<br>on 2006, September 27.84 we imaged P/2006 (Christensen) from the Remanzacco Observatory (0.45m reflector + CCD). On our multiple  stackings (28 unfilterd exposures, 60 seconds each, scale 1.9"/px, seeing FWHM= 4") a secondary nucleus or condensation is well visible:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/p8455
<br>Upon blinking, this tailward appendage is moving together with the main nucleus. The main condensation has m2= 17.7, the secondary has m2= 18.5 (unfiltered magnitudes, USNO-B1 catalogue) and is placed almost 10" in PA 240 deg from the main one. The secondary component appears less condensed than the main one; both nuclei are embedded within a tail extending 1.5' toward PA 240 deg. Our images, obtained on 2006, Sept. 20.97 with the same instrumentation (stellar limiting magnitude almost 20), show nothing in the vicinity of the primary nucleus.
<br>
<br>The secondary condensation in P/2006 S1 (Christensen) seems to be significantly similar to those we observed last May on 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann, during its consecutive splitting events. Additonal observations are encouraged.
<br>

<br>
<br>Hi Michael,
<br>thanks for your reply: on our images of Sept. 20, it wasn't present, neither. I hope that someone will be able to image it soon (goog S/N is needed), since looking at our frames, the suspect is that we are possibly seeing at a cloud of debris (like in 73P-B) instead of a "solid" secondary nucleus. From 73P-B, we understand the lesson that this kind of features could show a very quick variability (from hours to days) and that they could have a pretty short lifetime...
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

That is a very fine image of the tail structure.
<br>
<br>It is encouraging to learn that this can be
<br>accomplished with an SBIG camera, and that it does not
<br>require a Schmidt camera.
<br>
<br>The Schmidt camera images posted here recently are
<br>superb.
<br>
<br>I am curious if you see in your images any changes in
<br>the tail structure with time?
<br>
<br>Perhaps when it gets further above the horizon, this
<br>could make an interesting study. Your camera/scope
<br>combination resolve the tail of this comet very well.
<br>
<br>This is something I have not been able to do well with

hello charles

<br>thank you four your nice words.
<br>we are amateur astronomer. the schmidtcamera is now around 15 years
<br>old. some times ago i changed from film to ccd. this year i get
<br>a corrector for working with larger sensors.
<br>
<br>the images you see are taken with a SIGMA 1603 (KAF 1603ME sensor).
<br>maybe i will change in the next time to a KAF6303

Hi Mike,

<br>through the binoculair or the finder scope,but it was an easy

Attached a 120mm 35mm lense to a ST2000XM ccd.  Still some light in the

Hi Ralf,
<br>yes, C/2006 M4 (SWAN) do show a very structured inner coma, with a
<br>prominent solar-pointing fan. We are observing it since last week:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/ydfgxj
<br>http://tinyurl.com/uawf9
<br>http://tinyurl.com/y7scoo
<br>but we didn't care to report this stuff because, as noted by Eric
<br>Christensen on [Comets-ml] about a similar feature observed previously
<br>on 4P/Faye, this kind of solar-pointing fans seems to be as common as
<br>ordinary tails, for most of the active comets.

There are presently three bright comets to image:
<br>C/2006 M4 (SWAN)  magnitude 6.4 (7.9)
<br>4P/Faye magnitude 9.4 (10.7)
<br>P/2006 T1 (Levy) magnitude 9.6 (11.2)
<br>
<br>Note:  The above magnitudes are correct  they are the currently

<br>calculated magnitudes, as indicated above in parentheses. The
<br>calculated magnitudes are usually greatly in error.
<br>
<br>I imaged the brightest of the three - C/2006 M4 (SWAN) - because it
<br>was well positioned at sunset  the other two require staying up
<br>quite late to get them at transit.

I've been watching this thread with interest, and make the following comments.
<br>
<br>1. There is no doubt that your 3 images show differences. But the critical issue
<br>is the explanation for the differences - and whether a range of potential causes
<br>are sufficiently excluded.
<br>
<br>2. I find the animation too fast to analyse carefully. Also, it is not apparent
<br>which image is the first in the sequence. So while the animation highlights the
<br>variation, it detracts from analysis.
<br>
<br>3. My assumption is that the comet is still somewhat difficult to observe in the
<br>twilight. After all, you _only_ have 3 images. Significantly some of the
<br>variation in the images is strongly suggestive of twilight effects - notably the
<br>different extent of the faint regions.
<br>
<br>4. It is not apparent to me how you have co-aligned all the images - and thus
<br>the extent to which any displacements might be alignment-related. Similarly,
<br>have the 3 images been identically processed?
<br>
<br>5. It is also not apparent to me what the scale of the images are. That is, are
<br>the variations occurring over a distance at the comet of 1,000km, 10,000km,
<br>100,000km or 1,000,000km. This issue is important in the context of assessing
<br>whether variations over the time scale are consistent with the spatial area
<br>involved.
<br>
<br>6. Trying to deduce systemic variability from 3 images is a hard ask. Random
<br>variations can easily appear as ordered variations. Particularly for small-scale
<br>features, IMHO you need to have _at least_ 5 images that show a consistent
<br>variation to exclude random variations, and the other possible issues that have
<br>been suggested by others.
<br>
<br>So, while I'm not prepared to conclude there are no rotational effects involved,
<br>at this time I don't believe your images are sufficient to establish their
<br>existence. In my mind there are too many issues that aren't clearly excluded....

The Oct 8 animation is _far_ more convincing of short-term changes in the ion
<br>tail. However (i) the images you have combined are clearly of different exposure
<br>(as indicated by at least one image with a short star trail length) - and the
<br>greatest tail displacement is associated with this image of different exposure
<br>(which raises questions of whether the displacement is real or
<br>exposure-related), (ii) again the animation is too fast to critically analyse,
<br>(iii) the images are not contiguous, so that you have no sense of continuity in
<br>any variations, and (iv) it doesn't look like you have many images involved.
<br>
<br>I mention these issues in the hope that you will be able to make future
<br>animations that avoid these issues - such that there can be better confidence in
<br>the apparent changes. In particular, it is _really_ important that you exclude
<br>any differences that are under your control -  so that differences in the images
<br>cannot be attributed to those issues (such as processing issues). Thus you
<br>should take a contiguous series of images (so that any changes are visibly
<br>continuous), the images being of constant exposure - preferably relatively short
<br>to avoid blurring of any tail motion, and have the same processing applied to
<br>them before combining (even if the effects of twilight affect the image
<br>density). And I would prefer to see more background than you have shown - as
<br>this will better indicate general background variations that might indicate the
<br>presence/absence of other issues.

To bring this discussion to a good end, here are some images and animation
<br>from a day later
<br>(Oct 16) same technique used as the previous day.No special things are
<br>visible except
<br>a small jet at about PA~140 and a sign of fainter activity at PA~190
<br>approximately.
<br>
<br>Considering that the same technique was used, there is a thought that I may
<br>registrated
<br>some special activity on the 15th, which was able to cause such relative

<br>changings in the images,whether rotation-related or not.

Ralf...you have been reporting this as rotation, spinning and the sort for two weeks
<br>now.  Now you want to be objective?
<br>Not every observation will lead to a "discovery" of some sort.  They are very valuable

<br>Your observations are valuable....just keep them objective.

I fully support and encourage observations to be reported and discussed.
<br>
<br>The main tenor of those that have bought into the discussion seems to be - we
<br>are not convinced that the variations are not due to image processing issues.
<br>[Sorry about the double negative - but that is the appropriate way of expressing

Looking at the animated orbits of these two comets, I was thinking of

<br>You would have to keep the comet stationary and let

<br>movement in the tail structure.

<br>You can align centroids in gif images with CCDSoft.

</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
This comet is at about 9AU, but is still observable. I have posted a number of
<br>images taken on Oct 10 & 11, ad 21, 22, and 23 at:
<br>
<br>http://www.igomoo.com/aaa/index.php?option=com_rsgallery2&Itemid=26&page=inline&id=100&catid=29&limitstart=2
<br>
<br>The images are stacks of between 5 and 8 images, each of 5 mins exposure (the
<br>comet is faint!), and the image scale is about 1 arcmin per side. The images
<br>have north up, east to the left - with the comet moving to the south-west. The
<br>comet is at -43 deg.
<br>
<br>I would like to hear the views of others as to what is going on. In particular,
<br>the images of Oct 21 show a bright extended nucleus which appears bipolar - with
<br>little tail. The image of Oct 22 shows a single condensation with some tail.
<br>Tonight's image shows almost no condensation - but a sickle-shaped coma/tail.

Upon close inspection of a single subframe of my comet image from

<br>and lo and behold, out popped a bunch of 14 to 17 mag galaxies!
<br>
<br>I also made a small movie illustrating the very rapid (5.1 arc

<br>Hi MIke, your images are very beautiful as always!
<br>Do I use a NP101, which are your impressions on the NP127?

Thanks Rolando.  Good to hear from you as I have not done so in a while.
<br>  I like the 127is.  My problem is that after upgrading to the new 5"
<br>refractor and also going to the losmandy G11 to better hold it, I spent
<br>my money and was unable to get a new camera.  The SBIG ST2000XM is old
<br>and after the Maxcam10, which was "blowed up" I am hard to please.  The
<br>camera has been a really good one and one I can always depend on but
<br>the 3200 chip is just a big leap ahead and would have made a really
<br>good match for the new scope.  I have a Focal Reducer on order which
<br>will bring the 127is down from a 660mm to a 530mm which will image at
<br>F4.2  The FSQ which I lost was a 530mm working at F5.3 so I am gaining
<br>alot in speed.  I am looking for a used camera if anyone knows of any.
<br>Hope to see more of your images soon!
<br>Thanks, Mike

Hello.  I processed 30 images which are Bin 1x1.  I was or thought I
<br>was seeing some streamers north from the core area on the 20th.  The
<br>comet has now improved this area into a ---something---I don't know
<br>what to call it?  It shows well and I guess is dust and can be the
<br>start for the recent brightning as it was much brighter when these

<br>tail was any brighter.

Hi all,
<br>we have processed an image obtained last night by our fellow observer, Fabrizio Montanucci (Rome, Italy). It appears that the inner coma of this comet is showing a remarkable evolution, probably related to its recent outburst.
<br>
<br>The visibility of several jets is strengthened (one obvious feature points toward SE). The central condensation show a very odd -"peanut-like"- shape.
<br>

Hi all,
<br>we imaged again C/2006 M4 (SWAN) with the same instrumentation we used yesterday night: it appears that during this last 24h, its inner coma has changed again: now the central condensation appears less structured (just an E-W elongation, no "peanut-shape" features), while the jet toward SE we commented yesterday (that's probably the same stuff mentioned by Rolando) has decreased its strenght.
<br>Our image is available here:

<br>The image obtained by a friend of us (Silvano Casulli) show a very structured ion tail:

Hi Peter,
<br>
<br>Very nice images!
<br>
<br>After imaging C/2006 L1 (Garradd ) :
<br>
<br>http://www.klaas-jobse.net/cyclops/kometen/20061027_0400UT_L1_11x45sweb.jpg
<br>
<br>I tried to catch  P/2006 T1 (Levy ) but could not find in on my first images!
<br>
<br>I wondered because Guide 8  positioned the Comet next to NGC 3521, but it was not there at all.
<br>
<br>I searched the area but no sign of T1.
<br>
<br>Then I realized that I had not updated the ephemerid's in Guide for two weeks and at the same moment I saw T1 slowly crawling from under NGC 3521!
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the observations where hampered by passing clouds, bad seeing and low altitude, nevertheless I am pleased with my images after all.
<br>

<br>
<br>Best regards

<br>Klaas
<br>
<br>  I've added a couple of stacks of P/2006 T1 passing 9th mag galaxy NGC
<br>  3521 in Leo, the first guided on the comet and below that, guided on
<br>  the galaxy here:

<br>Hi Gerald!
<br>One compliment of yours is worth as gold as weighs!  ;-)))
<br>
<br>I always find your superlative images! Both those in b/n, but above all those color!
<br>
<br>Which technique do you use for making this type of photo? Is it because you use a

I waited last night for the edge of the clouds to pass after a strong
<br>cold front passed.  It was windy with 35mph northwinds and still some
<br>thin clouds but I put some information on the chip.
<br>In the past I have seen dark streaks behind comets.  I figured they
<br>were boundry lines between outgasing activity.  The images last night
<br>show this but if this was boundry lines it would follow the dust or gas
<br>boundry.  These are perfectly straight if you combine images.  Not so
<br>straight with one image.  These almost look like shadows.  Very strong
<br>in nature.  I have put muptible images on one picture and labeled
<br>them.  It occured this might be noise but they are always there.  4
<br>images are reduced in size and the bottom one is at full size but
<br>croped with a bin of 1x1.  Anyone know what the dark streaks are.  This
<br>has probable been discussed before but I don't remember it.

Hello.  Image from last night.  Most information is on the image.
<br>http://www.fototime.com/15B8B40723EE509/orig.jpg
<br>The next link is a little more in the way of looking for a possible
<br>result of the recent outburst.  Actually the same image as above but
<br>processed a little different.  The 5" at this time shows no parts that
<br>stand out although I was seeing what I thought were more than 1 bright
<br>area which is about all I would expect of my equiptment.  False color
<br>added to ease the eye.

A 5" is ok for faint comets as long as they look like comets.  The

<br>last night or can point it out I would appreciate it. The two lines
<br>point to where it is suppost to be - about.
<br>File is over 500kb and left full size although reduced in quality.

Greetings once again.  This one is or was a big image.  It covers 5' of
<br>comet.  The small galaxy at the end of the tail is NGC 6255 at
<br>magnitude 13.5.  Took 7 different images stiched in photoshp to show.
<br>Original is almost 4000 pix wide.  The original shows very good tail
<br>structure with all kinds of kinks, waves and some strange sudden
<br>stops.  If you look at #2 and #3 from right to left on the top side of
<br>the tail you can see the sudden stops I talk about.  Almost as if they
<br>came out in cycles.  Anyway this is a big image still at 1600 pix wide
<br>but any less and you loose what is there.  500 kb with the original at
<br>25+mb.  You have gotta love this comet!
<br>Thanks, Mike H.

<br>Actually currently my patience is put hugely on the test;
<br>I haven't seen the comet now since Oct 16 ,due to constant clouds.
<br>Nothing seen from the outburst and even days before the burst.

<br>
<br>We imaged C/2006 M4 (SWAN) almost simultaneously with Michael and Rerald, using a narrowband filter centered @ 647nm (FWHM= 10nm): what is seen in our picture is virtually pure dust:

<br>The dust tail stretch vertically (toward north) the frame.

<br>The comet is not inside the FOV. When using the latest orbital

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I imaged C/2006 M4 SWAN with my Canon 20D and EF 75-300 mm lens at
<br>f/8 and my E-160 f/3.3 6-inch astrograph with SXV-H9 for similar
<br>times. I was quite surprised at the results!  The DSLR subs were 19
<br>x 2 minutes while the cooled CCD's were 19 x 1 minute  but the
<br>cooled CCD was binned 2x2.
<br>
<br>I used simple JPGs rather than RAWs with the DSLR so my imaging
<br>technique is not optimal. I haven't figured out how to use the Canon
<br>software to download RAWs yet.

Mike - Yes, very curious features. These dark lanes in the ion tail
<br>are due to structures in the solar wind, rather than due to changes in
<br>the comet's activity.
<br>
<br>The wind carries the Sun's magnetic field outwards past the comet, and
<br>this magnetic field varies in direction. When the wind approaches a
<br>comet, it gets slowed down because of the ions that are added to the
<br>flow. The amount of decrease in solar wind speeds depends on the
<br>flow's distance from the centre of the comet: wind that passes closest
<br>to the nucleus is slowed down the most. So, a solar wind
<br>feature/boundary like a change in magnetic field direction is
<br>stretched out in the shape of a hairpin, or in 3D, like a cone.
<br>
<br>The motion of small-scale solar wind structures through the comet
<br>usually shows up as bright tail rays, as are obvious in many images of
<br>comet SWAN. However, it looks like you've caught a rarer and
<br>particularly sharp example of the magnetic field causing a decrease in
<br>ion numbers along the line of sight. Although people who work on this
<br>are agreed that it's solar wind structures that cause such features,
<br>the exact details of what's going on is open to debate.

Amar,
<br>from the last shots of these days it would seem that the activity of the
<br>tail
<br>of dust is slightly improved.
<br>I cannot say if the tail of dusts visually were visible,
<br>because my observatory is in the city of Rome
<br>I hope that other friends in list can answer to the others your questions

Michael.  I tried to set Guide8 which I use to show fainter stars but
<br>in this image the dimest shown by Guide is a little over 16.1
<br>magnitude.  All the brighter stars around the comet are 13+ to 15+

Nice tail developing it appears.  If the 40 mile per hour winds will

Hello.  Took a lot of information of this comet tonight and ended up

This comet has had me fooled.  I thought that the tail was towards the
<br>E and a little north of East.  Images showed what looked to be the
<br>tailand I had not checked my locations.  This image shows the correct
<br>orentation listed.  Kind of reminds me of 2005 E2 and that wierd tail

Hello.  I found this comet on another pretty clear night.  Only used
<br>one 30 second image.  It is interesting because of the position.  It is
<br>entering the Dark nebula LDN 678 (209) in Aquila.  To the W or right is
<br>a very busy star field and E is the nebula.  I left this, after
<br>croping, at a little over 1600 pix wide with the 1x1 bin.

Greetings.  This is a bit of a question.  The image has everything

Hello.  Tonight was a nice night for M4.  It crosses a nice dark nebula
<br>LDN 673.  This image is left full chip size but reduced 50% in size and
<br>quality.  Color and more information would have been nice.  P1 sits in
<br>the dirt and shows a spike to the east.  Would be nice to have this

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
Hi all,
<br>
<br>just to add my 2 cents re the 181P puzzle, last night I imaged comet 181P. I took 30 x 4 minute exposures @ 800iso with my 16" f4.5 scope and 10D DSLR camera from a dark rural site (the FOV is about 40' x 25'). I took the images on November 21.35-50 UT. It appears to be VERY faint. I could hardly see it on the 4 minute subframes.
<br>
<br>Based on the images (and the best subframe image I had), I roughly estimate the m1 magnitude to be 15 - 16ish. Based on previous experience of visually observing and then imaging comets, I would say this object is definitely not visually detectable with my 16" scope (note that I couldn't detect it on November 9th - my LM was mag 15.7 (~14 for comets))...
<br>
<br>The stack of 30 x 4minute (2 hours total) can be seen at:

<br>or

<br>
<br>A single cropped subframe (1 x 4 minute, Nov 21.39 UT) can be seen at (note, the comet can hardly be seen):

I lost the link to the M4 image in the last post so here is another if

<br>Dark nebula looks like an Arkansas Hillbilly to me looking East with

<br>4P looks good.  The galaxy cluster in the center is A313 magnitude 17.6

<br>Image taken with 14" Meade, stack of 8 x 90s exposures. Image is 10 x 14 arc

<br>Comet structure looks quite similar - although the tail seems broader in the

hi terry
<br>
<br>we could see the brightest part, maybe only cc.
<br>on single images with 1-3 seconds! cc seems to be fainter than a star

<br>at the moment P1 is on a good way. more to say isn't

Hello.
<br>Digging through the dirt to shoot below the horizion.  This is not what
<br>I had in mind for a nice picture.  I don't know what to say except it
<br>appeared brighter to me.  I was seeing string like filaments to the N/E
<br>with extreem processing which is not shown here.  It had a fuzzier
<br>appearence as compaired to a starlike, what ever that is, but I don't

Michael and Mike,

<br>Many thanks for your efforts in imaging this very interesting comet in such difficult conditions.
<br>
<br>If the brightening trend continues, hopefully, visual observation in twilight can be possible for northern observers in January ...

Hello.  This is a tough one.  I am pretty sure I have the comet.  This
<br>animation is a two frame 24hr. space between.  Each one is 12x30 sec
<br>exp with a 2x2 Bin.  There were so many flaws and pix that gave false
<br>impression I often wondered whether to remove them.  In this animation
<br>just below the galaxy PGC70004 mag 15.4 there is a spot that moves
<br>which I left.  Like I said I can be incorrect but The charts put the
<br>comet where it is in the images at the two dates of 12/07/2006 and
<br>12/08/2006 with the 7th being the top arrow.  Hope your screen will
<br>show this very small 18 to 19 magnitude speck. (If I am correct)

Hello.  I was forced to do things a little different tonight.  That
<br>sounds a little strange considering the time of day this image was
<br>shot.  I was unable to do a Bin of 2x2 and do an add combination.  The
<br>amount of information gathered was too great and washes out the image.
<br>This is back to a 1x1 bin and 10 sec images with the add combination.
<br>Because of this I don't know how much the comet has changed because of
<br>the processing and imaging, but the tail to the N/E is there.  I added
<br>15x10 second images, croped, enlarged 3x original, removed a gradient
<br>and adjusted the levels a small bit but not much.  I understand that
<br>some will think this is useless according to some private mails, but I
<br>am not seeing an influx of pretty images right now.  I hope to continue
<br>to post images as I can and maybe the guys on the other half of this
<br>crazy planet will pick up where we leave off.

Hello.  Here is the latest attempt to follow the comet.  Clouds in the

Michael,
<br>
<br>I just tried to identify the stars at the image. I guess left one is
<br>HD 163405 (VTmag = 9.06 mag) and right is HD 162796 (VTmag = 7.97
<br>mag). I can see that the comet is much brighter than both of these - I
<br>think it is definitely brighter than 7 mag (and that's only central
<br>condenstaion...)

<br>Hi Charles,
<br>prompted by your note, we imaged this comet from the Remanzacco Obs.:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/y8x7lv
<br>
<br>In our picture there is evidence of a narrow tail (possibly an ion tail?!) toward South-West.

Thanks for confirmation on a tail structure. Hope to shoot more subexposures next time out.

<br>The ephemeris for 76P says its outbound and just now passing closest to earth.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I thought I would mention that this comet remains active, even though it is
<br>9.4 AU from the sun (9.0 AU from the Earth) and over 2 1/2 years from
<br>perihelion. I've just placed an image (stacked - 12 x 5 mins) at:
<br>http://www.igomoo.com/aaa/index.php?option=com_rsgallery2&Itemid=26&page=inline&id=135&catid=29&limitstart=4
<br>
<br>The image size is almost 5 arcmin square. The nucleus is quite diffuse, and
<br>there is clear indication of a faint tail in PA 225 - of over 2 arc mins.
<br>
<br>A previous series of images (in October) is at:
<br>http://www.igomoo.com/aaa/index.php?option=com_rsgallery2&Itemid=26&page=inline&id=100&catid=29&limitstart=2
<br>
<br>I think I'm the only one to have reported astrometry of this comet for over 12
<br>months now. Given that it is still active at such a large distance, it is
<br>perhaps disappointing that others are not observing this comet.

Michael.  You nailed it good this time.  Clouds were close I see.
<br>Each day at my location clouds roll in from the plains to the NW.  I

Very useful image, Michael. Thanks for sharing !
<br>
<br>    In my recent visual negative observation ( Dec. 21.74 UT: m1= [ 5.0, 25x100B, mountain
<br>location, very clear sky; nautical twilight; alt. 3 deg ), I've used Zeta Scuti as one of the
<br>references in the field, finishing the observing session when this star set behind a snowy
<br>ridge. A beautiful view in the binoculars.
<br>
<br>I'm glad to see now C/2006 P1 in good health, near Zeta Scuti ...

Splendid and detailed work, Michael ! McNaught's comet seems to be developing a nice tail.
