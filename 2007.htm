Hello.
<br>  There was about a 4 minute window between too light and loss below
<br>the horizion.  Info is on the image.  I tried many kinds of

<br>tough one.

hi mike
<br>
<br>it is good to see, that dslr showed the comet very well.
<br>i think ccd will bring out more details. i observed P1 last evening
<br>the lrgb image was only 11x0,1 sec filter clear
<br>and rgb each 0,1 sec. the tail is nearly 0,5° long.
<br>
<br>i post it in a few minutes.

Michael.  I am impressed with that image.  Have tried different

<br>
<br>I think DSLR's can really do good work in deep twilight with these
<br>shorter exposures as there is little latency between images (readout is
<br>virtually instantaneous).  This allows you to acquire many images in a
<br>short time, improving signal to noise.  I am hoping to image the comet
<br>in daylight this way :).

<br>on some ccd-images (jan 3, 5, 7, f-540mm, o,1-0,3 seconds) i saw this

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">

<br>I looked Sunday morning to find the comet.
<br>Took some photos but could not see it definitely with my naked eyes or the photos (I have no binocuulars).
<br>
<br>After getting home I realized through the reports that the comet can be seen after sunset as well as in the morning. I looked up with my  Starry Night Pro and found this was true.
<br>
<br>I rendezvouzed with a Doug Zubenel and another  member David Young showed up after my alterts went out.
<br>
<br> Doug Zubenel and I set up above a ridge looking West   near 95th street west
<br>of a Church building in Shawnee, KS, USA (West of Kansas City).
<br>
<br>Looking in binoculars and Doug's telescope , David Young spotted the comet first
<br>with his binocularabout 5:30.   We then saw the comet with Doug's scope about 9
<br>degrees above horizon.
<br>Spectacular !
<br>I think it looked like a light gold colored star like space shuttle
<br>trailing a yellow-white fan shaped plume (that usually appears
<br>the TV usually shows space shuttle with a telescope )
<br>
<br> We figured it was -1. Once you know where to locate it , you can watch it for the next few nights.
<br>
<br>We watched  it for almost a half hour . Then as it went close to the tree on horizon we saw the last glimpses of it in between the distant trees.
<br>
<br>Amazing all the comets that have appeared that did not fullfill expetations. Now this one comes out of the sky and is putting on an amazing show that may get even better.
<br>
<br>Don't miss it.
<br>
<br>We will try the next few days at the same spot.
<br>
<br>Good sky chart on Sky & Telescope and a good one on Spaceweather.

Hi Chris,
<br>I just looked at my digital images of  the comet this morning and I have
<br>exactly the same affect recorded on some of the frames. About 1/3 of what I
<br>shot is nice and steady and the rest are slightly blurred with
<br>double "nuclei" present either from the wind or vibrations transmitted by my
<br>hand when I released the shutter. In a couple, the images are identical to
<br>yours while in a few others, the "split" is visible down the comet's tail.
<br>In the telescope, even though seeing was not great, there was no question I
<br>was looking at one nucleus. My observations were made on Jan. 8, 13:05 UT.

Hi Bob,
<br>
<br>I think we're seeing the effects of some sort of mirror slap
<br>vibration in the cameras.  I was so convinced there was a double
<br>nucleus but visual observations by numerous people do not confirm
<br>this.  I tripped my shutter by a cable release but did not lock up
<br>the mirror.  Next time, I'll use the old hat trick to reduce any
<br>chance of vibrations.
<br>
<br>Glad you got some shots of it!

I imaged the comet on January 6 through my 20-cm SCT using the

Hello all,
<br>
<br>> I think we're seeing the effects of some sort of mirror slap
<br>> vibration in the cameras.  I was so convinced there was a double
<br>> nucleus but visual observations by numerous people do not confirm
<br>> this.  I tripped my shutter by a cable release but did not lock up

<br>
<br>there could be another explenation: differential refraction. I'm seeing this effect

Hi list,
<br>
<br>I had much better conditions this evening for imaging the comet. I
<br>picked it up around 4:45pm EST in 10x50's. It became a easy naked
<br>eye target around 5:10pm and was truly spectacular in 10x50's.
<br>Because of atmospheric extinction, the comet was a gorgeous golden
<br>color with a tail visible for about 1.5° in length.
<br>
<br>I used the Stellarvue SV80S triplet refractor @ f/6 with the 20D.
<br>Considering how low this sucker is, around 4°, I'm quite pleased with
<br>these shots. Imagine if this comet was visible high up in a dark
<br>sky!! It's hard to estimate the magnitude but I'd put it around -1.0

Not just another pretty picture; this and other images being posted are positive
<br>indicators that this is a very bright comet, contrary to words being written that this
<br>comet should not be compared to "Cometxx" or that formulae "suggest" that the comet
<br>cannot be brightening as it truly is.
<br>
<br>Without a doubt, a "picture is worth a thousand words...."  And these are textbook

Here's a shot from this evening. I used a Stellarvue SV80S triplet
<br>refractor to get in close to this beauty. Weather was ideal with no
<br>wind and clear skies. This will most likely be my last image of this
<br>amazing comet. Weather is suppose to turn poor tomorrow and she's
<br>diving into the glare of the Sun.
<br>
<br>I'm not a expert on estimating the magnitude of comets, but I do know
<br>it was much brighter this evening compared to yesterday. I picked it
<br>up with my eye only seven minutes after sunset! Taking atmospheric
<br>extinction into account, I'd put the mag at -3.0. I'll be interested to
<br>see what the experts say.

<br>Great gob!  I have a roll of "vivid color"  film taken with a Minolta
<br>35mm SLR and various lens which I hope to have processed tomorrow.
<br>It has been a long time sence film has been used by me.  I look to
<br>96P in a few months for our chance to image the next big comet!

<br>
<br>Due to the very low position for us and recent bad weather, I had
<br>difficulty picking up the comet until this evening, though once I had
<br>spotted it (with binos), I could see it naked eye.  It may be bright
<br>on an absolute scale, but because of the poor contrast it was a bit of
<br>an underwhelming sight.  :(  I hope it performs well for those in the
<br>southern hemisphere.
<br>
<br>By the way, one of the better shots taken by one of our club's members
<br>was shot from a commercial flight over Greenland!

<br>Space Weather News for Jan. 13, 2007
<br>http://spaceweather.com
<br>
<br>Observers around the world are reporting that Comet McNaught is now visible
<br>in broad daylight. The comet is very close to the sun, so it is tricky to find.
<br>If you want to try, here's how to do it: Go outside and stand in the shadow
<br>of a building so that the glare of the sun is blocked out.  Make a fist and
<br>hold it at arm's length.  The comet is about one fist-width east of the sun.
<br>
<br>This weekend is a special time for Comet McNaught because it is making its
<br>closest approach to the sun.  Solar heat causes the comet to vaporize furiously
<br>and brighten to daytime visibility.  McNaught is now the brightest comet in
<br>more than 40 years, and it may become the brightest in centuries.
<br>
<br>Visit http://spaceweather.com for photos and updates.

Hello all,
<br>
<br>during daytime on 13 Jan. I could obtain some images of the comet with
<br>an 400mm/f5.6 Canon objektiv and 400D body. Exposure times are 1/2000
<br>and 1/1000 at f8.

<br>Times are 12h45 and 12h57 UT, 13.Jan.2007
<br>
<br>I suspect the brightness around -5m, but could it not see with naked
<br>eyes because of sky brightness near the sun.
<br>
<br>In the future I could sum my images of that day (a few dozens) to get
<br>more S/N out of it.

Hi,

<br>During daytime on 13 Jan. I could obtain some images of the comet with
<br>an 400mm/f5.6 Canon tele and 400D body. Exposure times vary between
<br>1/2000 and 1/800 at f8.
<br>Yesterday I uploaded only two single frames. Today I worked through my

<br>and another in false color. (it brings details out better)

<br>Times of the 23 raw images are between 12h45 and 13h06 UT, 13.Jan.2007
<br>
<br>Today I observed the comet only for short time visually, because of
<br>clouds. It maintained its brightness of about -5m.

<br>second one contains Venus in the upper right hand corner (not marked)

<br>Hi All, not much in the way of tracking or close ups, yet. But these
<br>will make nice keep sakes just the same, as they approximate the
<br>natural vista we had, that was a bit affected by haze of various kinds,
<br>still my third day of wonderful views looking over the suburbs again,
<br>at last.
<br>wonderful comet, I'm a bit worn out already thoough, lol, can you have
<br>to much of good thing? ;) sheesh what a phenomenon! :-)))

     With some ( not-wanted ) delay, we've posted in the C/2006 P1
<br>section of our site ( http://www.perihelio.org/brill2007.htm ) some Juan
<br>Fernndez's images of the comet at perihelion, Jan. 12, taken from Monte
<br>Naranco ( Asturias, N. Spain ).
<br>
<br>     Obviously, they are not as spectacular as recent South Hemisphere
<br>images with a long curved tail showing synchrones ... But it was the
<br>best that weather allow us to do from the cloudy Asturias.

<br>> About the apparent size of comet McNaught's: I think that we haven't had yet the real
<br>> "perception" of the total dimensions of its tail, since it's currently splitted in two
<br>> hemispheres! Some friends (R. Ligustri and M. Fulle) were observing this comet few hours
<br>> ago from northern Italy (Latitude +46 deg N), and were still able to see a magnificent
<br>> series of striae extending well above the west horizon. In the next days it would be
<br>> nice to put together the contributions from both sides of our planet, in order to have
<br>> an idea about the "real" size of this monster...

I just photographed the tail synchrones of McNaught from

<br>excellent. It required quite a bit of image processing to get it done.
<br>Briefly, I stacked 5 images  (25 sek, 200 ISO, 50mm f/2.8, Canon EOS

<br>I also received news from Christian Harder and Manfred Holl, who made

Hello All,
<br>It's surprising to see the striae in tails beign imaged from the

<br>what will be for +13 degree latitude which is midway to both the
<br>hemispheres? How 'good' or bright will the tail be from here? And
<br>how long will the visibility last here? How above the horizon, the
<br>exact direction, and what are the best times to look for it? Finally
<br>if it needs to be photographed then what are the best exposure times
<br>for a 28-105 mm SLR camera with ISO 400 film at lowest aperture of
<br>f/4 to get it recorded on film? Any help will be appreciable. If

Hello Amar,
<br>It's going to be difficult to see them now with the moon coming back into
<br>the evening sky but they may still show on a camera with a time exposure. I
<br>had good luck using ISO 800, f/2.8 and a 35mm lens with an exposure of 25-30
<br>seconds. At f/4 you'll need to expose for about 1 minute. I think a 50mm or
<br>shorter lens would work well.
<br>Good luck to you and share your photos with the list if it works.

Hi,
<br>  Had my first decent look at 2006 P1 from a dark sky site tonight (22
<br>jan ), certainly missed the best of the 'spectacular widefield tripod
<br>comet shot' comet, she's fading very fast, as you all  know, yesterday
<br>I could get a good image at iso 100 - today it needed to be 1600 with
<br>the digital at a dark sky site! - yikes! many features have gone
<br>sub-visual pretty much, or nearly anyway, wasnt nearly as prominent in
<br>the twilight, what she must mag +1 easy i guess, is that a fading of
<br>around a magnitude a day!!?, I think 2002 V1 was similar from memory?
<br>P1 still covers a large part of the sky in its entirety thats for sure,
<br>as I have seen it said 'it dominates the night sky' thats a good
<br>description, P1 'owned' the sky!
<br>hope some film shots turn out - not to hopeful unfortunately, anyway
<br>what a amazing sight, glad I went out :-) thats engraved in my brain
<br>thats for sure.
<br>
<br>oh well, let the guiding begin! seen some good examples already, she's
<br>a nice long duration exp. object still!

Hello Mr. Bob,
<br>        Thanks a lot for the kind advice. I went yesterday to our
<br>dark-sky site and waited for sun to set and darkness to emerge. But
<br>as will happen to most of them, clouds were present ONLY in the
<br>south-western horizon, with other horizons totally clear, even
<br>though some part of sky was clouded up. After it started getting
<br>dark, Moon was too bright also reflecting light in the clouds, so
<br>I didnt even want to attempt it. Maybe tomorrow when Moon's higher
<br>up, it might be possible, but still it'll be more brighter. Looks
<br>like the chance for our latitude of this is gone now..Is it? This
<br>cant happen..we never got the best of the comet's visibility and now
<br>the oppurtunity to capture the tail is also gone :(
<br>
<br>By any chance is there some way to calculate how long this tail and
<br>it's features will remain visible at best? Thanking You. Amar.

Hello Amar,
<br>I'm sorry to hear you could not see the tail. Yes, the moon really makes it
<br>difficult now. I haven't heard of any naked eye sightings of synchrones for
<br>the past day or two. Like you, I am hoping that after the moon is out of the
<br>sky again, we'll have another chance at spotting the synchrones. I don't
<br>know how long they might be visible. One observer on the list reported what
<br>he believed were sychrones from the comet in the morning sky near
<br>Aquila/Del. The dawn sky is still moonless so perhaps it might be a good
<br>idea to try at that time. And if you don't see them, take photos anyway.
<br>When I saw them last week, they were faint visually but showed up very well
<br>in the camera.
<br>Good luck and good observering,
<br>Bob

 Greetings Bellatrix and Amar and others
<br>
<br>We had 4 marvelous days while observing the comet here in Kansas with binoculars and telescopes. I even took a video of it (my first out of 38 or so comets!!). &#92;
<br>While we got "the short end of the stick (so to speak)" in the Northern Hemisphere,The comet was still most  exciting and marvelous to see, truly one of the best of all time.
<br>I hope we might have a change to catch the comet tail here in Kansas City area after the clouds and snowstorms. So  I echo the sentiments of those of us who still hope to try weather and moon permitting.
<br>
<br>I hope we still have a chance.
<br>I would be interested who else sees the tail in the next few days.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile thanks for the website below to find those beautiful pictures by others down under. Makes us which we were there now seeing this true spectacle but I am glad we saw the lesser parts of this splendor nevertheless.
<br>
<br>Thanks again.

John.  Very well done.  I like the head shot for perspective. (is
<br>that you)  The image done with the 11000 camera is great.
<br>Interesting that before this comet traveled south I imaged it on the
<br>8th and with the ST10XMEI the core area of the comet bloomed totally
<br>out of controll with unfiltered images of only .02 seconds.  In the
<br>future if another brighter comet appears in dark skys this will be a
<br>problem that blooming cameras will have to deal with.  Hope the next
<br>one is a northern comet as we never get any decent comets up here.

<br>The dust is very strange, like a disk around the nucleus.

Hi group!,
<br>  Went out to a dark location last night and just caught the last half
<br>  hour before the moon rose. Whilst driving there, and out in the dark, I
<br>  thought I would look for comet out my drivers side window while
<br>  driving, as I knew where it was, and was amazed how easy it was to see
<br>  at a glance! naked eye, and at a glance, could instantly see the whole
<br>  tail, flash a curving spray over 26 degrees up to SMC - what a sight!
<br>  After taking a wrong turn, and arriving late at around 10 pm local time
<br>  7th feb 2007 (11:30 7th UT) , I didnt have time for some of the things
<br>  I had planned - but took a couple of tripod shots with 350D anyway.
<br>  Moon made a big difference to tail length once it was even slightly
<br>  over the horizon, instantly halving it.
<br>  I had charts all made up for proper obs, but didnt get a chance, but
<br>  did a rough estimate of coma's brightness, and it was certainly around
<br>  the +3.5 magnitude mark.
<br>  here are two, quickie processed, 30 sec, iso 1600 single shots, no
<br>  darks, and from hi-res jpg only at this stage, one using 50mm f 1.4
<br>  lens @ f 1.4 and other kit 18-55 mm @ 18mm and f3.5
<br>  18mm wide field was already affected by moon to a fair degree - so lost
<br>  some of tail in it.

<br>
<br>  One day I will put a page together, but I will have (hopefully) better
<br>  versions of all shots, as I am unfamiliar with much astro digital
<br>  processing atm, and need to work it out on a PC as well, with RAW
<br>  versions and stacking (I use a mac mostly) and I need some film shots
<br>  done as well, so no point atm.

Gerald.  Is the new scope a 1100mm FL at F 3.8?  If so that will do a
<br>great job on the small faint comets.  I ordered a FR for the 127is to

<br>Gerald. Is the new scope a 1100mm FL at F 3.8? If so that will do a
<br>great job on the small faint comets. I ordered a FR for the 127is to
<br>have a 530mm at F 4.2. Hope to get some bigger, brighter comets to
<br>use this with.

<br>Hi Mike,
<br>they agree with you, this comet is a lot, very strange! ;-)))
<br>from what have understood in ml, also the physics of this comet is very strange! I cannot

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">

<br>
<br>I have been imaging Comet C/2005 E2 McNaught for a few weeks as a class
<br>project to measure the angular and physical length of the tail. I stack a
<br>few more images and find a much longer tail length. Using 15x120 sec stacks
<br>from Astrometrica, I got a tail length of over 24 arc minutes ! You can see
<br>almost all of it in a GIF animation I posted to my results page at
<br>http://arthur.sewanee.edu/obsv/view.php
<br>
<br>I used a 0.30 m SCT at f/9.7 ( 2910 mm ) and a SBIG STL-1001E CCD. The FOV
<br>is around 28x28 arc minutes. Pixel resolution is around 3.38 arc seconds per
<br>pixel. I log scaled the FITS images with CCDOps to make the GIFs show more
<br>detail and then used Microsoft's GIFAnimator to make the animation of the
<br>three GIF frames. It is easier to see the end of the tail if you animate the
<br>images. I did not do anything with the cosmic ray hits and other artifacts,
<br>so it may look a little noisy, but it clearly shows a much longer tail than
<br>other recent images.

Your image clearly resolves the tail.
<br>
<br>All I could really tell from the image from my last post was that it
<br>was at least 5 arc minutes. It was so faint that I could not resolve
<br>beyond that.
<br>
<br>I think your camera is much more sensitive than the one I have at

Received this in an email.  Very interesting.
<br>
<br>"I'm pretty certain that you've imaged Encke's dust _trail_ (rather
<br>than tail). These structures were first observed by the IRAS
<br>satellite, and they're thought to consist of mm-cm sized grains that
<br>slowly spread around short-period comets' orbits. They've been
<br>observed at visual wavelengths previously (though for the first time
<br>only around 5 years ago, I think), but I think this may be the first
<br>time that amateurs have reported detecting trails.
<br>
<br>There's a nice description of the structures here, by someone studying
<br>them in depth:
<br>http://physics.ucf.edu/~msk/projects/trails/
<br>
<br>Will try to access the images from IRAS if I can figure out how.

Hello Mike,
<br>indeed this is a dust trail. Its visibility is enhanced, since during these days our planet is crossing the orbital plane of the comet.

<br>Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>I confirm your observation. Also I have photographed the comet on February 16
<br>and also in my image it is visible (very faint) the structure that you point out.
<br>however I thought that it was a defect of the calibration, due to a bad dark.
<br>thanks your image now  I know that is not it! ;-)

<br>============================================================
<br>"Hi Mike Holloway,
<br>
<br>That is a very nice image.  I'm not positive it is the trail, but it
<br>does appear to be at the correct angle (55 and 235 degrees E of N),
<br>assuming N and E are exact.  Trails are notoriously difficult to
<br>detect, usually because they are very faint.  There is an optical image
<br>of Encke's trail on the second page of the paper at:
<br>
<br>http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2003/pdf/2056.pdf
<br>
<br>They took 17 hours of images from the Kitt Peak 2-meter and co-added
<br>them to find the trail.  The trail was at 4 AU from the Sun at the time,
<br>but today it might take 30 minutes to an hour of 1-meter telescope time
<br>to detect it.  That being said, what could those features be?
<br>
<br>That is a total exposure time of 720 seconds, right?  How large is the
<br>image's field-of-view?  Encke moved about 15" over that exposure time,
<br>not counting CCD read/download time.  That seems small enough that,
<br>besides moving along 68 degrees E of N, there probably isn't some weird
<br>smearing effect.  The direction of the sun is right along one of the
<br>trail directions (237 degrees E of N).  That complicates things a bit
<br>more.  The anti-solar feature might be an ion tail, and the feature in
<br>the solar direction could be a sunward jet.  That's my guess anyway
<br>(Encke is known for strong jet activity).
<br>
<br>The angle between the Sun and trail is changing and will increase to 8
<br>degrees on March 6.  Encke might be getting to low to image, but if you
<br>can still get it, then that would be a better time to tell if this is a
<br>trail or something else.  Thanks for sharing the image!"

<br>Michael and Geralds image which was posted on the 17th of Feb was

<br>I've posted an image of Comet 2007 E2 Lovejoy that I've taken after 2 weeks of continuous cloud. It can be viewed at:
<br>http://tinyurl.com/2gug5v
<br>
<br>It is a stacking of 5 x 4 min exposures, each tracking on the comet. Altitude was low, so seeing and tracking was not
<br>good. The image shows an elongation in PA 230d of almost 2 arc mins from the nucleus. Presumably this is a forerunner of
<br>a tail. [The image size is about 5 x 8 arc mins].

<br>
<br>Hello dave,
<br>I enclose here the image-processing output based on the averaged file.
<br>
<br>This averaged image is much better than the previous one to extract fine details within the coma: I can confirm the
<br>previous comments (i.e. asymmetric coma, presence of jets). But now it's clear that there is something more: I enclose a
<br>"what is it"? file, where I have pointed to a nice feature not visible in the add .FITS I have seen before; I bet
<br>dollars to donuts that this is another filament of the ion tail (~40" long toward PA 190 deg): it's visible in all the
<br>elaborations, included the infamous Larson-Sekanina rotational gradient algorithm.
<br>
<br>Looking carefully at you .FITS, I get the impression that actually all the SE quadrant of the tail (say, the sector
<br>comprised between PA 240 deg and 180 deg) is somehow "mottled". Try by yourself to look at it through different
<br>contrast/threshold visualization levels.
<br>My suspicion is that it's rich of ion tail streamers, just a little above the detection threshold limit. Unfortunately
<br>the S/N is not enough to be sure about the reality of this stuff, however it would be very funny if we find this kind
<br>of, say, "noise" just in one over four quadrants of the tail image!
<br>
<br>Thanks for having provided me the opportunity to play on such an interesting object.
<br>
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni
<br>
<br>****************************
<br>I attach here the preliminary results of my image-processing:
<br>1) cut_fut.fit is a part of your original frame, where I have subtracted the sky backgroud gradient
<br>2) MCM and RWM are, respectively, an azimuthal median subtraction and a 1/r theoretical coma subtraction
<br>3) LS is the classical Larson-Sekanina rotational gradient filtering
<br>
<br>There is one possible problem with your stacking: it seems that in the nuclear region you are away from the linearity
<br>regime of the CCD camera. This normally creates some trouble with image processing routines. If for the stacking you
<br>used the "add" option of "Astrometrica", try to "average" the same frames: it might help.
<br>
<br>For now, I would say that from this image we have hints of a slightly assymetrical coma (it looks like more developed in
<br>the NW quadrant) with possible ion-tail filaments in PA ~237 deg (main componenet) and PA ~220 deg (secondary ray);
<br>unfortunately these two features are embedded in a broad dusty-like tail, that makes difficult to understand the
<br>situation unambiguously.

<br>
<br>I photographed the latest comet Comet Lovejoy.
<br>see blog
<br>http://eoas-dreric1kansas.blogspot.com/
<br> (near middle of picture hazy star)
<br>Students will
<br>(E.O.A.S.1) Compare and contrast this comet ( tail shape, size, distinct
<br>nature etc) to the pictures of magnificent Comet McNaught , which we could see in
<br>the Northern skies only for a few days in January 2007 before it displayed its
<br>huge tail in the Southern Hemisphere.
<br>
<br>(E.O.A.S.2) This comet will only reach magnitude 7 (but  comets can change,
<br>as they are like cats - they are unpredictable,  someone said). Compare to the
<br>other parts of the magnitude scale and compare it to McNaught, aided eye,
<br>Venus and others.
<br>
<br>This comet is famous for the fact that it is the FIRST comet to be captured
<br>with a digital camera -a canon XT, just like the one I have . I was not in the
<br>right place at the right time because the discoverer is in the Southern
<br>Hemisphere.
<br>
<br>I thought we could not see the comet in the Northern Hemisphere until around
<br>4/15 but I captured it (Black and white here) last night (60 seconds). It has
<br>a greenish tint and I am working on a color image and will try to show it
<br>soon. It seems to have a slight fan tail shape and the coma (head is distinct ) as
<br>you can see. It is about 8th magnitude which as many people know unobservable
<br>to the naked eye. We won't be able to see it without a small telescope or
<br>binoculars with its closest approach in about a week.
<br>

Hello.  Weeks of bad weather allowed for a few minutes of imaging last
<br>night.  I almost in some way wish it hadn't.  This image was not posted
<br>untill now because of the strange look.  It is a simple add of 4x30 sec
<br>exp.  I couldn't seem to get rid of the N/S (top to bottom)streaks.
<br>Felt they were real but just didn't know what they are.  Sent a private
<br>email to Michael Jaeger as his image from the 9th of this month showed
<br>faint structure to the north side of the comet so I knew he had it.
<br>  It seams to have increased.  His image information (about the
<br>structure) was undescribed.  I now think it is real but have no idea
<br>what this is.  Jet?  Was hoping to image again but bad storms are
<br>moving in.  Michael said he would try to get this on the chip again
<br>tonight.  I hope he can.  This comet is a really amazing small object.
<br>Hope discussion will begin was Michaels comment.

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>At first (in February) I did not think this structure was dust trail,
<br>but now I think it is probably dust trail.
<br>Because this curved structure coincides with the orbit of 2P/Encke.

Gidday Mike, Masayuki, and others,
<br>
<br>I have uploaded a short avi file that shows 20070410 images  of 2P
<br>Encke.
<br>I think the radial tail features are becoming apparent. I get an
<br>impression that they are curved. They are still quite faint, so I
<br>will try to measure them in the next sequences.
<br>
<br>Kind regards, Alan Watson

<br>maybe 96 P fade slower than expected and we could

This comet is ideally positioned for imaging from the Midwest USA as
<br>it high (57 degrees elevation) and transits at a "reasonable" hour 
<br>that is, at astronomical darkness. At magnitude 13.0 it is an easy
<br>target.
<br>
<br>It has a relatively fast motion relative to the star field, 6.2 arc
<br>seconds per minute.  I imaged it in one-minute frames with at 5.0
<br>arc seconds per pixel.
<br>
<br>The fast relative motion lends itself to a nice animated GIF. I have
<br>a small (422 kB) video of 1 hour of the comet traversing 6.2 arc
<br>minutes of Leo. Take a look. The comet is really racing along!

A small post with this one.  Look at the comet and see if you think
<br>this is a split.  Maybe the comet split and I just don't know about
<br>it.  Might be worth some followup to see if I am full of ___________ as

Subject:  Brightest Comet in the Sky  Dont Miss It!
</pre>
<hr>
<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
C/2007 E2 (Lovejoy) is nearing its peak on light curve  see
<br>http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2007E2/2007E2.html
<br>
<br>This is presently the brightest comet in the sky (save for a few
<br>lucky souls near the equator who might still be able to view
<br>2P/Encke). Better grab a view or an image now, before it fades into
<br>oblivion.
<br>
<br>It is racing though Aquila at 8.8 arc seconds per minute at
<br>magnitude ~ 7.6.  I was limited to 30 second exposures when I imaged
<br>it to avoid blur.
<br>
<br>I "think" I saw (using averted vision and averted imagination) the
<br>comet in my 4-inch refractor piggybacked on the 6-inch E-160 f/3.3
<br>astrograph. I synthesized a simulated eyepiece view for my web page
<br>linked below.
<br>
<br>I was baffled for quite a while looking for the "missing star", V606
<br>Aquilae, that was depicted prominently in my SkyMap Pro screen shot
<br>as being very bright but was missing in my image  even though all
<br>the other stars were right where they should be.  How could I not
<br>image a bright star???  The mystery (for those that haven't figured
<br>it out yet) is solved on the web page.
<br>
<br>Let me know what you think of the movie. It really was hard for me
<br>to get the hour's worth of frames to look about the same.  The comet
<br>was rising in the sky (and thus getting brighter as the atmospheric
<br>extinction was decreasing); at the same time, the sun was rising, so
<br>the sky glow was increasing.  Balancing the two effects to achieve
<br>consistent histograms drove me nuts! I've probably invested ten
<br>hours in image processing and composing the web page.
<br>
<br>Images, associated data, eyepiece view, imaging notes and *movie*
<br>all at
<br>http://home.att.net/~dpersyk/new.htm
<br>
<br>Please take a look and give me some feedback.  This was quite a
<br>processing challenge for me. Thank you for visiting my site.
<br>
<br>Clear skies,

Thank you sir.  There is a star at the position I marked and that was

<br>structure shown in this processed negative image.  I am sure it is

Hello Joseph,
<br>
<br>Imaging a magnitude 19 comet is very impressive!  How did you align
<br>the 20 second exposures?  I assume you couldn't see the comet in a
<br>single frame.  Also, what is your VLM?

Hi all,
<br>
<br>I imaged Comets McNaught (C/2006P1) and Lovejoy (C/2007E2) a few nights ago (April 26.72,73 UT). Both were imaged with a 41cm (16") f5.2 Meade Newtonian and SBIG STL11000M CCD. Exposures were (10L, 5RGB) 30 seconds for Lovejoy and 60 seconds for McNaught. Both were cropped slightly but show an approximate FOV of ~45' x 30'.
<br>
<br>Lovejoy is looking good for you northern folk soon...

Hello Dennis,
<br>
<br>how align the 20 second exposures?
<br>No, I couldn't see the comet in a single frame!
<br>You must have a program like "Astrometrica" (Herbert Raab, Austria).
<br>here you can do astrometry of stacked images.
<br>20 or 40 images, adding up the signal of a faint object. Stacking the
<br>images:
<br>By "Track and Stack" the images can be shifted to compensate the motion
<br>of an object. If you select "Track and Stack" you must know the
<br>coordinates
<br>(you must have USNO B1 or UCAC2 for reference-star) and the speed (some
<br>"/min)
<br>and the direction (P.A.) of the apparent motion of the asteroid. You
<br>will find all this datas
<br>in the ephemerides in MPC.
<br>I will give you the link for Astrometrica:
<br>http://www.astrometrica.at/
<br>If you have this program you will have a lot of work with the "Settings"
<br>(in english):
<br>- Observing Site
<br>- CCD
<br>- Program
<br>- Environment
<br>- Internet
<br>When all settings are well done Astrometrica will work. You are already
<br>able to
<br>identify the asteroide as the only point among the star trails or you
<br>will stack another pair
<br>of images to identify the asteroide by blinking.
<br>Finally Astrometrica will give you the "MPCReport" and you can send it
<br>to harvard!
<br>I hope this helps and you can understand my bad english!
<br>(I was teacher of french and have forgotten all my english!)

Hello Joseph,
<br>
<br>Thanks for the excellent explanation.  I thought you must have used
<br>Astrometrica or AstroArt 4.0. I have been avoiding those
<br>applications because, as you say, there is a "lot of work" in the
<br>settings.  Hopefully the first few tries are the hardest and then it
<br>gets easier.  After seeing the way you brought the very faint comet
<br>out of the noise, I am inspired to give your method a try.

It is unfortunate that you have avoided using Astrometrica because of a perception that
<br>there is a lot of work to do in setting it up. Yes, there are settings that have to be
<br>specified. The most critical are the pixel size, the telescope focal length (and you have
<br>to go through a bit of trial and error to get the actual focal length, not the nominal
<br>manufacturer's focal length), and the image orientation (both left/right, as well as
<br>rotational angle about the optical axis). But that is the equivalent of setting up your
<br>scope for the first time. Once you have done this, Astrometrica is a _brilliant_ piece of
<br>software that makes astrometric measurement of images both incredibly simple, and highly
<br>accurate. Typically it takes me about 60 secs to do a measurement (from selecting the
<br>image(s) through to the generation of the position). IMHO, Astrometrica is the astrometric
<br>solution of choice, being a highly optimised dedicated astrometric solution. (And don't
<br>assess its value by comparing its nominal cost against the commercial price of other
<br>packages. Price is not a valid indicator of the quality of the product...) With my 14" I
<br>regularly do 'track & stack' to do astrometry on faint objects - the extreme being moons
<br>26 and 29 of Saturn, which never get brighter than 20.5 and 20.0 respectively. And my
<br>several asteroid discoveries have come about when doing a track & stack for faint comets -
<br>and those asteroids were all fainter than mag 19.0 when I discovered them.

<br>Hello Joseph,
<br>
<br>Thanks for the excellent explanation.  I thought you must have used
<br>Astrometrica or AstroArt 4.0. I have been avoiding those
<br>applications because, as you say, there is a "lot of work" in the
<br>settings.  Hopefully the first few tries are the hardest and then it
<br>gets easier.  After seeing the way you brought the very faint comet
<br>out of the noise, I am inspired to give your method a try.

<br>> You must have a program like "Astrometrica" (Herbert Raab,
<br>Austria). here you can do astrometry of stacked images.
<br>> 20 or 40 images, adding up the signal of a faint object. Stacking
<br>the images:
<br>> By "Track and Stack" the images can be shifted to compensate the
<br>motion of an object. If you select "Track and Stack" you must know
<br>the coordinates (you must have USNO B1 or UCAC2 for reference-star)
<br>and the speed (some "/min) and the direction (P.A.) of the apparent
<br>motion of the asteroid. You will find all this datas
<br>> in the ephemerides in MPC.
<br>> I will give you the link for Astrometrica:
<br>> http://www.astrometrica.at/
<br>> If you have this program you will have a lot of work with
<br>the "Settings"(in english):
<br>> - Observing Site
<br>> - CCD
<br>> - Program
<br>> - Environment
<br>> - Internet
<br>> When all settings are well done Astrometrica will work. You are
<br>already able to identify the asteroide as the only point among the
<br>star trails or you will stack another pair
<br>> of images to identify the asteroide by blinking.
<br>> Finally Astrometrica will give you the "MPCReport" and you can
<br>send it to harvard!
<br>> I hope this helps and you can understand my bad english!

Hello David,
<br>
<br>Setup is not what's keeping me from using more sophisticated
<br>stacking software  more like sheer laziness. My camera is hard-

<br>and I have all the imaging parameters established save perhaps for

<br>This isn't true: I usually stack 100+ images without any problem.
<br>
<br>> AstI wonder if anyone on

<br>
<br>I'm using both applications: for stacking Astrometrica is far better, while for image processing Astroart is superior. Both of them are great softwares, however I think that you cannot make a comparison, since they were developed for different applications (Astrometrica is a very specialized package).
<br>
<br>IMHO Astrometrica is simply the best software readily available to amateurs for astrometric purposes, while Astroart is an excellent general purpose image processing software (with the possibility to perform astrometry, but obviously with much less potentialities in this field of application compared to Astrometrica).

Hi everyone!
<br>
<br>   I took some pictures of a comet in period May 2nd 2007 20:23(UTC) - May 2nd 2007 20:32(UTC). I&#8217;ve got 19 good quality pictures with retention interval of 30 seconds each one.
<br>   After summation I discovered 4 dim and 1 luminous objects. I guess they are moving along with the comet.
<br>   So I have a supposition that the core of this comet is collapsing. But maybe it&#8217;s my mistake&#8230;
<br>   Has anybody of you guys watched taken some pictures of this one at the same time? Please, confirm or disprove the fact of collapsing.

Knew this would be hard and it was harder than that.  Arrows show a
<br>galaxy in the lower right and a faint galaxy which guide did not show
<br>or list (so the ?).  Between the 10.18 mag star and the other arrow is
<br>where guide showed the comet to be.  I put the arrow on a place next to
<br>a faint star (to the left) that is the only area I can find that did
<br>not show on DSS images.  Appears to be an elongated area compaired to
<br>the DSS images.  Maybe -- maybe not, or could be in another area or
<br>maybe not showing at all!

Very nicely done guys!
<br>
<br>It looks like you have layered 2 versions of the same image, one a
<br>median stack registered on the comet and a second registered on the
<br>stars.  Perhaps you did the second version on another night when the
<br>comet wasn't there.  In any case it definitely works.

Hi Terry,
<br>
<br>Thanks - you are right the process is finished by Photoshop Layers but with
<br>pictures taken in  the same night. We only separated the stars from the
<br>comet.  We tried different kind of processing to remove the startrails from
<br>the comet layer and to remove the blurred comet from the starfield layer.
<br>There are some scores to consider to avoid a reduced information or to
<br>obtain artefacts but I think we are on the right way now.

<br>  Checked your web sight at the link and will go back to do some more

I recently attempted it and detected it just once several weekends ago.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>here's a rather ugly photo and info about Terry's new comet (C/2007 K5) taken with a 41cm (16") @f5.2 Newtonian and SBIG STL11000M CCD last night (24 hours ago) - Wednesday 2007 May 30.25-29 (0600 - 0700 hours) UT. The sublights were one minute due to the very bright Moon. North is up and East is left. The FOV has been cropped to about 30' x 20'.

I've posted an image of this comet at:
<br>
<br>http://tinyurl.com/22ynmg
<br>
<br>It is a stack of 9 x 90sec exposures with a 14". Image size is about 3 arc mins on each
<br>side. By way of reference, the magnitudes of the bright star at the top left corner, and
<br>the brightest of the group of stars very close to the comet (the one just under and to the
<br>left) - extracted from the NOMAD catalogue are:
<br>
<br>  Mb    Mr
<br>12.09  11.88
<br>14.81  14.53
<br>
<br>I should add that a close look at the stacked images - esp. stacking sub-groups and
<br>blinking them, does not indicate the presence of any tail - just a circular coma. To the
<br>extent that the image suggests the possibility of a tail, the stars close below the
<br>nucleus lead to a false assessment.
<br>
<br>I've also done an update to the orbit solution. While I have again forced e=1, the initial
<br>solution had e very close to 1 (a full solution gives a nominal e of 0.987 with no
<br>noticeable improvement in the residuals - which means it should be forced to 1 at this
<br>time. This implies the orbit is now fairly good.) There is not much change in the solution
<br>since yesterday - about 0.2 deg in several of the elements...

Hi Mike,
<br>Great image! I was trying to see this comet last night but wasn't sure of
<br>seeing it. Could you tell me what time you shot the photo and which
<br>direction is north? It would help in estimating how bright the comet was in
<br>relation to the starfield for me. Many thanks!

Bob,
<br>
<br>If I'm right, the time is June 4th, 3:30 UT approx., and North is up. The
<br>brightest star is TYC 1417-765-1, mag. 9.59.
<br>
<br>Hope it helps.

Juan,
<br>Yes, I was out trying to find both Lemmon and C/2005 L3 Mc Naught. L3 was
<br>faint but relatively easy to see at 13 mag with a stellar nucleus as viewed
<br>in my 37cm reflector. It was only 30" across. Lemmon was a great challenge
<br>because of its lower elevation. I could only suspect it so I was hoping to
<br>use your image as a guide to its brightness. Tonight's skies look good so
<br>I'm going to try again. Thanks for all of your detailed information - it
<br>really helps.

Thanks Charles.  I would like to see many more images but maybe a lot
<br>of people have the bad skys as I had for almost three months.  Only a
<br>day here and there to put the comets on a chip still.  I tried again
<br>for C/2007 F1 on the chip last night but once again I only found a
<br>very faint smear which was too close to background to call.  Needs a
<br>bigger scope now I guess.

<br>Hi Mike,
<br>seem me that this year the weather in Australia, has not been of the best!
<br>also here from us it is not the maximum one...
<br>in the last two months they have been really little, the good evenings.
<br>
<br>however if I am able, I will try to follow the evolution of this comet,
<br>besides is the only decent! ;-))))

Very nice comet image. Thanks for posting.
<br>
<br>>From TheSky6 view for your July 5, 2007 2102UT, your image
<br>orientation appears to be North up and East left, the inner coma
<br>appears extended in PA ~185, as in development of tail. Seems more
<br>obvious in red channel. Outer coma appears very diffuse and larger
<br>in green channel with a diameter of about 6 to 7 arc mnutes. (arc
<br>distance from GSC 4434:1175to GSC 4434:972)

<br>
<br>elaborating the image, him note that the comet is following the evolution

<br>particularly with the filter LS are seen two throws depart from the forgery nucleus.

It is racing though Draco at 8.4 arc seconds per minute at magnitude

<br>I couldn't really get it to stand out, I could barely make it out as I was

<br>In my image Up is to the right.  Since it was just over Polaris,

<br>http://comete.uai.it/comete/C2006VZ13_070706.jpg
<br>
<br>where there was a reddish tail going against/across the star

Hello Carey and Jeff,
<br>thanks for your comments. The shape of this feature seems to point to an ion tail, that is normally blue (CO+ ions). However a reddish hue can be indicative of H2O+ (or dust; but the latter sound unlikely, since this comet has not shown till now great dust productions).

yes, I was surprised to see that the tail was in anti-solar direction where
<br>you would expect to find the ion tail, and not in the path of travel where
<br>you would expect a dust tail.  And the reddish color I would expect dust not
<br>ion.
<br>
<br>The tail is so short that it is covered by the glow of the coma.
<br>My images were for 120 seconds.  I wonder if I would get less glow and more
<br>tail by taking more short exposures.
<br>
<br>I have the next 2 days off, and will be out again Saturday.

Have you wondered what Comet McNaught looks like now? Its current declination is -71 deg,

<br>The image is a stack of 5 x 180 sec exposures, and is about 5 arc mins across. The image

<br>a larger coma should be visible.),

<br>Hi Carey,
<br>in the image we just shoot (twilight conditions) it's possible to appreciate its extension to, at least, 15'. However it's pretty faint, and you need to stretch quite a lot the image settings to evidence it.
<br>http://tinyurl.com/2lp65v
<br>>From its appearance, I think that it's definitely an ion tail.

<br>> Hi Carey,
<br>> in the image we just shoot (twilight conditions) it's possible to
<br>appreciate its extension to, at least, 15'. However it's pretty
<br>faint, and you need to stretch quite a lot the image settings to
<br>evidence it.

<br>> From its appearance, I think that it's definitely an ion tail.

<br>Hi John,
<br>nice shot, congratulations. Yes, I think that it's the same stuff we were talking about. However, in order to extract it from the sky background more clearly, you need to stack a number of images and play a little with the image-processing.

<br>Thanks Giovanni. Just getting familar with the software and

<br>moving fast, I should have taken more Track and Accumulate series at
<br>f/3.3. But, I reset to prime focus and tested image exposure and
<br>tracking at that focal length.
<br> I did not track and accumulate comet images therefore it took me
<br>some time to process the series of images. Will upload that image
<br>soon. Spend more time imaging other deepsky globulars and the Ring.

The comet has an ion tail that I had difficulty bringing out in my
<br>processing. It is just barely apparent in my stack of  40 x 60s.
<br>However, I was able to bring out what appears to be a 15 arc minute
<br>tail using the Larson-Sekanina filter in AstroArt 3.0.  I realize
<br>this is a somewhat "dangerous" filter since one can easily introduce
<br>no end of interesting artifacts.  I would thus appreciate feedback

<br>
<br>Hello Dennis,
<br>your image is really nice (you have plenty of signal out of the coma). The faint tail visible in your Larson-Sekanina output is genuine.
<br>
<br>Here I detail what I normally do applying the LS filter: first I locate the brightest pixel within the coma; this is the photometric center of the false nucleus, and we must refer (click on it with the mouse) on it in order to proceed further (remember: it must no be saturated, otherwise all the process will be compromised). Then it must be decided with which parameter the software has to be feed. Normally I start with delta=0 and alpha= 30 degrees. With this settings you can normally evidence radial structures that depart from the central condensation (i.e. tails, rays, jets, etc.). If you enter a delta parameter different from zero (either positive or negative) and several combinations of alpha angles, it shold be helpful to extract any possible concentric feature to the central condensation (like shells, halos, etc.). How to know which parameters one has to adopt? Well, there is no fixed recipe, just try and error. Particular care has to be taken to avoid the interference of stars (trailed or point-like) within the coma; for this reason, in crowded star fields is better to "median" a number of single exposures (the median will nearly delete the star trails). The LS is an "easy" method that enables to get a quick look at the coma; however, as you correctly pointed out, it is prone to generate artifacts, so a cross check with other image processing routines is needed, if you want to be sure about the results. In a sense, one can define the Larson-Sekanina filtering as "fast & dirty".
<br>I will send you privately the output of my own experiments on your nice shot.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Giovanni

<br>Very nice job!.  The ASA is a great scope.  I guess I was the only one
<br>that though the tail of this comet would have extended out a lot more
<br>after it's closest aproach to earth.  Kind of thought it might follow

<br>
<br>well, perihelion is yet to come on August 10th.
<br>but it will only be .055 AU closer to the Sun
<br>and .46 AU further from Earth
<br>as Earth heads East and the comet heads West and South.

Thank you for your suggestion and critique Vitali. I
<br>do have much to learn. Your image of P/2007 N2 is very
<br>sharp showing a nicely defined short tail. Thank you
<br>for sharing the info about it.
<br>
<br>This was my first attempt at this newly recovered
<br>comet. My sky was very humid that evening. I was not
<br>sure I would even capture anything. I had no idea then
<br>there was a tail. I was not aware that the motion was
<br>so high until I stacked the images with Astrometica
<br>the next afternoon. Those are my mistakes for not
<br>checking and planning better.
<br>
<br>Looking again at the announcement in IAUC 8856: P/2007
<br>N2 = P/2002 O5 issued 2007 July 16, there is mention
<br>of a tail about 15" long in p.a. 135 deg by G.
<br>Lombardi and E. Pettarin (Farra d'Isonzo, Italy).
<br>
<br>Also looking back on posts in this group, there have
<br>been four image posts of P/2007 N2 since the IAUC on
<br>July 15, 2007. While no one mentioned a tail, a small
<br>tail is only obvious (at least to me) in Giovanni and
<br>Ernesto's excellent image posted on Mon Jul 16, 2007

Hello Mike, I had coincidentally questioned about the very similar

<br>comet, with a 6th mag prediction and a '?' while going through the
<br>BAA's "A Comet's Tale" online file and "Comet Prospects for 2007". You
<br>can see my post with heading "BAA's journals (correction?)" and the
<br>answers that followed in comets-ml.

A very interesting event was captured this morning at ASO (Petit Jean Mountain South MPC

Greetings.  A question to ask of all the members.  As you know I
<br>consider the members of this board the best at imaging comets in the
<br>world.  I've always tried to image and expand with the equipment I
<br>have.  I am currently using a ST10xmei and ST2000xm ccd.  The digital
<br>single lense reflex camera will extend with my 5" TV127is refractor
<br>what my CFW8 and ccd's are doing now but I am after a single shot color
<br>with the larger FOV and feel the DSLR's have reached a point that look
<br>appealing over buying a larger ccd such as thge 11000.  Can you please
<br>give me your own oppinion of what you would use or what you are using.
<br>My budget is not unlimited but the "you get what you pay for" is a true
<br>statement in most cases.  Attaching the camera, pix, cost, ease of use,
<br>true color output, chip noise, manual setup, shutter speed are some
<br>considerations for me.  I am looking at future bright comets for this
<br>camera although it will be used in everyday work/play with a lense.
<br>Thanks for your time and if the members feel this is not comet related
<br>please answer off page at the listed email tricks46@yahoo.com .
<br>Looking forward to your replys.

<br>Hi Mike, I try to give you an answer in base to my experience.
<br>
<br>for different years I have tried to photograph the comets with ccd Sbig and filters or
<br>also ccd Sony and filters.
<br>however these beautiful objects have the particularity to be, a lot of times, fast and
<br>visible to strange times: just before the dawn or shortly after the sunset...
<br>for this, I have noticed whether to use the traditional ccds with the filters, to the
<br>times, it is really difficult.
<br>
<br>for this, two years ago I have purchased a ccd of the Starlight the SXVM25C and honestly I
<br>can say that it works really well!
<br>
<br>in comparison to the DSLR, I have compared this with my partners, you have from 1 to 2
<br>mags. in more, you don't have to make the dark and he is cooled for which, in the summer,
<br>you don't have big problems.
<br>
<br>But there are two problems:
<br>1)    it is that you owe, with openings F5, to do at least 5 minutes of laying, better if
<br>longer; in contrary case you owe "to work" more to balance the colors.
<br>2)    because of the strong sensibility, in comparison to the DLSRs, the stars have the
<br>tendency to saturate and to become white, with a light halo (using my NP 101)
<br>
<br>the other problem is the cost and the dimensions of the sensor that are not comparable to
<br>the format 36mm.
<br>
<br>an alternative could be the modified DSLRs, but you lose in sensibility and in the summer
<br>they don't work very well.
<br>

Mike,
<br>
<br>The pros for DSLRs:
<br>
<br>* Low cost + Large field of view.
<br>* Moderate sensitivity, the blue and green pixels well matched to
<br>comet photography.
<br>* One shot.
<br>* Very low read noise in some cameras.
<br>* Live view (depending on model) very handy for focusing.
<br>* Autofocus also works well on bright stars.
<br>* Dual daytime use.
<br>
<br>The cons of DSLRS:
<br>
<br>* Not as sensitive as CCDs (for stars about 1 mag difference in
<br>limiting magnitude, but perhaps less for comets - see my note above).
<br>* Dark Calibration can be tricky because there is no temperature
<br>regulation at the sensor.
<br>* More artifacts in images. eg. you will often see faint vertical
<br>and horizontal banding in images that can be hard to process out.
<br>* Limited dynamic range (12 bits instead of 16), although this is
<br>changing.
<br>* Raw images are sometimes filtered with noise reduction (some
<br>models are known to apply noise reduction to long exposures).  This
<br>can hurt sensitivity.
<br>
<br>I have done a lot testing of DSLR cameras as well as monochrome CCDs
<br>and in terms of quantum efficiency there is fair hit, although peak
<br>green sensitivity seems to be around 40-50% (for the green pixels).
<br>Although we are waiting for more tests its possible the new Nikon D3
<br>may have pushed quantum efficiency to new levels for consumer
<br>cameras.  Pity its $5000!
<br>
<br>Have you had a look into the Kodak KAF-9000 based cameras?  The
<br>sensor is huge (38 x 38 mm) with Quantum efficiency around 65%
<br>(peaking around green) has antiblooming and low read/dark noise.
<br>These sensors cost about the same as the KAF-3200ME that goes into
<br>the ST10XME (~$3000) so hopefully SBIG can do one at a similiar cost
<br>to the the ST10XME.

<br>image in color.  Would it be possible to see the lum. images you took

Hello.
<br>  This image of what I beleive the two arrows on the right side show
<br>50P also contains the galaxy NGC 1058.  The 2 markers #1 shows I think
<br>a super nova or at least where there was a supernova.  The #2 is
<br>another area which I cannot ID with DSS images.  Someone else might
<br>tell if this is a star or something else.  The comet was less than
<br>expected if this is the comet.

Re:   Loneos
<br>Another surprise comet, one that may get to magnitude 4 is in the sky. It is
<br>still very low on the horizon and difficult to see.
<br>
<br>We shall see (it is now at mag 8). Once again   this one has a green tint to
<br>it so it is a little more difficult to see for some observers.
<br>
<br>The guy who took the picture that for spaceweather.com is working towards his
<br>silver comet award.
<br>I encourage anyone (at ASKC or belonging to Astronomical League or another
<br>astro club) who is interested in comets,   to try for the silver award.
<br>
<br>You get a cool pin and great certificate .
<br>
<br>Remember that for the award you can make either   sketches, ccd images or
<br>regular photography or a combination of the 3 types.
<br> Of the first 12 (for the silver) , 2 from that can also be before 1/1/2001 .
<br>
<br>Those who have observers and data can send their results to me for
<br>verification (let me know if you want the materials back) and to get your pin and
<br>certification (includes a great photo by the late Vic Winters).

<br>> www.spaceweather.com has a report on Comet LONEOS and a sky map for
<br>> tonight.  Right now it's below and to the left of the star Cor Coroli
<br>> (?)and is in Coma Berenices below the handle of the Big Dipper. It's
<br>> at 8th magnitude and has a greenish color.  Hopefully, I'll get to see

hi mike
<br>
<br>this was no outburst. in the past we could see a lot of such comets.
<br>first the brightens very fast, than the stopped.
<br>for example, on the way to sun kudo-fujikawa stopped at 5-6mag

<br>
<br>nice   animation of the current 8th magnitude COMET LONEOS
<br>http://spaceweather.com
<br>10/13/2007 (if not this date go to archives)
<br>COMET LONEOS: Comet LONEOS (C/2007 F1) is plunging toward the sun and solar
<br>heating is doing its work: pieces of the 8th-magnitude comet are boiling off.
<br>"We were surprised to see blobs moving in the tail," report Filipe Alves, Jan
<br>Lameer and Jose Ribeiro at the AstroQueyras Observatory in the French Alps.
<br>This 24-minute time-lapse movie shows the view through the observatory's 30-inch
<br>telescope on Oct. 12th:
<br>
<br>Comet LONEOS makes its closest approach to the sun--just outside the orbit of
<br>Mercury--on Oct. 29th. At that time it may become faintly visible to the
<br>unaided eye, a 4th magnitude fuzzball with an increasingly active tail. Amateur
<br>astronomers, ready your telescopes! [sky map] [ephemeris] [3D orbit]
<br>AL Gold   comet award winner also writes
<br> More: "This comet is so close to the horizon, it is almost too low for my
<br>equipment," says astrophotographer Mike Holloway of Van Buren, Arkansas. "How
<br>low? I ask my neighbor across the field to keep his cows penned up so they don't
<br>block the view. Well maybe not quite that bad! I did manage to capture this
<br>image on Oct. 11th using a 5-inch refracting telescope."

Thanks Charles.  These animation exposures were 120 sec each.
<br>movement in the 15 minute period was enough that as dim as the comet
<br>is I have nothing to stack the comet on only the stars.  I think you
<br>should try 75P if you can use the astrometica software or some other

Hello All,
<br>Amazing images in this group, as usual! Great work everyone. I would
<br>like to ask could anyone see the short dust tail visible in some of
<br>the images, atleast by Michael Jaeger, especially the ones on 14th
<br>and 15th Oct? It's clearly visible there as a short and faint
<br>extension some 20 degrees to the right of the main tail from the
<br>coma. It appears to be 7-8 times smaller than the length of the main
<br>tail.
<br>
<br>Any updates on that? Is it observable visually in larger scopes by
<br>any chance? Thank You. Amar.
<br>
<br>PS - Which is the comet on the homepage? Can the moderator please
<br>put a short note everytime an new homepge image is uploaded for
<br>members to know?

Hello Mike,
<br>
<br>how can you see the comet (8P/Tuttle)
<br>"easy on single frames" ?
<br>It is not easy to find it on your photo (10x50s)!
<br>It is easy to find UGC 7956A !
<br>Minor Planet Ephemeris Service you gives 13.5 mag
<br>but I got - with Astrometrica - only 18.2 mag
<br>I got in the morning of 2007-10-17 with 12" Newton, f/4.8
<br>+ SXV-H9 :
<br>17P/Holmes   18.7 mag
<br>29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann   17.9 mag
<br>110P/Hartley   17.8 mag
<br>and 8P/Tuttle   18.2 mag
<br>I will sebd the photos the next days.
<br>
<br>PS: I found your 8P/Tuttle because I had prepared the
<br>material for astrometrie.

Hello josef.
<br>  That is a fair question.  My opinion of easy to find is and object
<br>seen on the raw image being downloaded from the camera to the
<br>computer in real time.  Many times I have had to process the raw
<br>images with all kinds of tricks to get a comet to show up.  UGC 7956A
<br>is an easy object even at magnitude 16.5(guide).  For a little
<br>reference I have posted two images.
<br>#1 - this is a single image with only a dark applied and no other
<br>processing.  It was the first image of the 10x50 stack I used for the
<br>posted image you refered to.  It was converted to a jpg with no
<br>compression.
<br>http://fototime.com/EABCFE2BAFAD1DA/orig.jpg
<br>#2 - This is a 2 frame animation of the first and last image used in
<br>the refered to image.  Movement is slight but there.
<br>http://fototime.com/4BE5FCE18B1D2DE/orig.gif
<br>I do not estimate magnitudes.  Past discussion on equipment used and
<br>magnitudes arrived at is where an image like this might be effected.
<br>I tried to find 8P with my LX200 10" last week and could not.  I went
<br>to the 5" used here and had no problem.  Maybe some of it has to do
<br>with computer monitors used by each person?  I don't know what the
<br>magnitude of this comet is but a condensed central area for me works
<br>out good.
<br>Thank you

Please sir---What does this mean?  "I" have no doubt "I" have imaged
<br>the comet but your image shows little - to - nothing.  This must
<br>bring the apateure and size of the scope into issue.  There needs
<br>more input and I welcome it.  Does my pictures show the comet or
<br>not?  Am I under a really false misconception I got the comet? If
<br>not  this requires a total revamp of my imaging, and  if not at least
<br>a total revaluation of which equipment can be used for giving
<br>magnitude est.   Perhaps it shpould be limited to a really restricted
<br>kind of aperature giving magnitude estimates.  Are there members here
<br>who would give there opinion of yes or no to whether I have or don't
<br>have the comet?
<br>I understand this has been covered before by such estemed members as
<br>Mr. Bortle but maybe one more time this can be addressed and although
<br>I am not a member of the ML board transfered for discussion.

<br>
<br>Astrometrica normally provides you a kind of m2 (nuclear magnitude). For diffuse objects (like 8P/Tuttle in this days) the m2 could be significantly fainther than the total magnitude of the comet.
<br>
<br>The last CCD brightness measurement I found on the net for this comet, is that provided by the Observatoire Chante-Perdrix, Dauban, that measured a m1 (total) magnitude of 15.0 on 2007, October 07.78.
<br>Seiichi Yoishida reports in his homepage that -"Now it is 15.4 mag (Oct. 7, Masayuki Suzuki)".
<br>The ICQ webpage reports as last brightness estimation for 8P/Tuttle this entry:
<br>2007
<br>Sep. 16.04, 13.5:, 0'.6 (M. L. Paradowski, Lublin, Poland, 0.20-m reflector);
<br>
<br>>From the above mentioned reports, I consider that the m1 of this comet should currently be close to ~mag.15 (unfiltered), so well within the reach of a 5 inch scope + CCD used under reasonably dark skies (expecially if the target is well above the horizon when imaged).

<br>
<br>correct, in the hurry yesterday I have forgotten to write that the measure was with an

<br>with an opening of 30", always with the filter Rc, measures 15,8

<br>
<br>What version of Starry Night Pro (SNP) do you use ?
<br>
<br>I use SNP v4.5 on Mac OS X.3 system to plot the positions of comets and
<br>it works well up to m1=22 which is quite sufficient for me !
<br>Beyong this threshold, comets aren't displayed and also not labelled,
<br>you can only center the field of view on the computed position of the
<br>comet.
<br>
<br>I just made a try on 2 comets : 7P/Pons-Winnecke computed by SNP at mag
<br>20,8 is displayed, but 6P/D'Arrest computed at mag 30,1 isn't.
<br>
<br>I haven't the most recent version of SNP to see how the human interface
<br>has evolved. In v4.5, you can adjust the magnitude threshold up to
<br>which comets are labelled and also the brigntness of the displayed
<br>pattern of them via the Options/Solar Sytem.../Comets submenu.
<br>
<br>Are faint comets available when you do a search based on their name ?
<br>If not, you can also adjust the number of comets in comets.txt file
<br>read at SNP-startup within LiveSky/Preferences for auto updates...
<br>submenu : I don't remember how many were present as a default value but
<br>it wasn't sufficient (I have entered 250).
<br>
<br>Please feel free to contact me privately if you want more details.
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>
<br>Stephane

Fantastic,   I really like the SNP program.  I have the 3.1 version and was looking at the newer versions but could not find the mag limits.  Mag 22 should be well enough,  the program is great as far as comet location,  its the faint stars over mag 16 that would make it easier to pinpoint location.  The 3.1 version enables comets to 22 mag and also number of * at startup so its really star mag that interests me. I use blink to confirm.
<br>  Any luck with 7P.   That would be great to get that.  Here is a page I have just started,  any critic would be welcome.  Thanks a bunch. http://www.flickr.com/photos/jrs63

<br>What version of Starry Night Pro (SNP) do you use ?
<br>
<br>I use SNP v4.5 on Mac OS X.3 system to plot the positions of comets and
<br>it works well up to m1=22 which is quite sufficient for me !
<br>Beyong this threshold, comets aren't displayed and also not labelled,
<br>you can only center the field of view on the computed position of the
<br>comet.
<br>
<br>I just made a try on 2 comets : 7P/Pons-Winnecke computed by SNP at mag
<br>20,8 is displayed, but 6P/D'Arrest computed at mag 30,1 isn't.
<br>
<br>I haven't the most recent version of SNP to see how the human interface
<br>has evolved. In v4.5, you can adjust the magnitude threshold up to
<br>which comets are labelled and also the brigntness of the displayed
<br>pattern of them via the Options/Solar Sytem.../Comets submenu.
<br>
<br>Are faint comets available when you do a search based on their name ?
<br>If not, you can also adjust the number of comets in comets.txt file
<br>read at SNP-startup within LiveSky/Preferences for auto updates...
<br>submenu : I don't remember how many were present as a default value but
<br>it wasn't sufficient (I have entered 250).
<br>
<br>Please feel free to contact me privately if you want more details.
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>

<br>Hello Ramon and all,
<br>yes, the outburst is real, and we congratulate wuth Juan Antonio Henríquez Santana and our spanish collegues for the discovery of this extremely interesting phenomena. Right now we are performing some follow-up of the outburst remotely from RAS-NM. Here is a preview: the proper motion of the comet is evident, as well as its extreme brightness (severe blooming on 60 sec image through a 25nm reflecotr + CCD):

Hello Giovanni and all,
<br>The comet is now naked eye at mag. 4.0!
<br>Here are my observations over the past 10 hours:
<br>After hearing of Ramon Naves' observation last night on comet-images,
<br>I looked at 17P/Holmes with a 25cm reflector at 76x and 214x on Oct.
<br>24, 4:10 UT. The comet was a mag. 7.1 "star" with a yellow hue. This
<br>morning (Oct. 24, 11:15UT), the moon was out of the sky and seeing was
<br>excellent. To my amazement, 17P had brightened to naked eye visibility
<br>being nearly equal to 48 Per at visual mag. 4.0. In the same
<br>telescope, the coma showed an intense, nearly stellar false nucleus
<br>about 2.5"-3" across set in a small, 10" diameter, much fainter, fuzzy
<br>disklike coma. The nucleus was distinctly yellow. The comet's
<br>appearance was very reminiscent of McNaught last winter when seen in
<br>the daytime sky. What a sight!

<br>  Dear colleagues,
<br>
<br>  17P/Holmes seems to have reached to the maximum. It kept the same
<br>  brightness during last two hours. The rapid brightening seems to have
<br>  stopped.

this is the our photo of the comet done to the 19:44 TU from Talmassons, with crossing of

<br>
<br>observed with the binoculars it seems me equal to the star delta Per, with a reddish

What an incredible sight....to the naked eye, it appears as a bright new star in the
<br>constellation of Perseus, high in northern skies and never rising nor setting throughout
<br>the nights of the next few weeks.
<br>
<br>Comet 17P Holmes, a very obscure and dim object to say the least only 30 hours ago, is
<br>blazing away at a brightness increase rarely seen before in such a short period of time,
<br>rising more than 15-16 magnitudes since October 23.  Now at brightness 2.0 (ASO, Oct. 25
<br>UT, 04:10) and perhaps still brightening, this comet must be watched continuously for
<br>the next several weeks.
<br>
<br>It appears as you seen in the first light photo from ASO; this is an RGB color image
<br>from an ST 401-ME camera, 12 second images in each color and combined.  No post
<br>processing, just a raw image, showing the brilliant round yellow-green huge (nearly 3
<br>arc minutes across) coma.  The very high contrast negative imaging reveals a possible
<br>dust tail coming nearly due north (down) from the comet as well as one streaming from
<br>the south side of the coma.  The image was taken with a 0.4m SCT at f/3 at the
<br>observatory (Harvard MPC H45) at Petit Jean Mountain in Arkansas.
<br>
<br>This unusual "round comet" to be so bright without a tail or irregularity is something
<br>very extraordinary.  The comet can easily be seen with the naked eye, but even
<br>binoculars and telescopes give the impression that the viewer is peering at a very
<br>bright star.
<br>
<br>The field of view in both ASO images is 12 arc ' by 7' with SOUTH up.
<br>
<br>For those with no image attached, please visit the report with both color and high
<br>contrast negative (showing possible dispersion from the coma), at the Arkansas Sky
<br>Observatory (ASO) website under the "ASO News Links" on the home page at:

Hi Dr. Clay!  Fancy meeting you here.
<br>
<br>I just discovered this group a couple of days ago.  Holmes is unbelievable.
<br>I went out last night to try to see it and saw the "extra star: in Perseus
<br>and thought to myself "That CAN'T be it."  Then I checked and that was it.
<br>It looks like it's going to pass right by Mirfak in a mid November!

Hello.  At the link is a number of different images of the comet

Even more incredible each night; the comet 17P (Holmes) now measures 255 arc minutes

<br>09:55 U.T. and the field measures 6 x 6 arc minutes.  The nucleus was measured

<br>opposing (from the nucleus) scintillating condensation equally offset from center, but

Hello Dave and thanks for this correction; indeed of course that should have been "arc
<br>seconds" rather than arc minutes; the field that is shown is approximately 7 x 6 arc
<br>minutes with south at top.  Much appreciated.

UPDATE: October 28
<br>
<br>The comet has increased dramatically in size and complexity; (see LAST image on this
<br>page) details are:
<br>NEW image is posted at: http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=1429.msg6902#msg6902
<br>Coma diameter, overall:  348.3" (average 8 measurements, CCD)
<br>Coma inner core (bright) diameter: 117.3"
<br>Dark "compression/shock" ring in outer coma:  204.2"
<br>Nuclear magnitude - 9.8 (average)
<br>Total magnitude = 2.3
<br>
<br>NOTE that even though the comet is considerably larger on this morning than on the
<br>previous morning, the brightness overall has dropped (naked eye estimate utilizing Alpha
<br>Perseii and Alpha Cassiopeia).
<br>
<br>The last picture in this sequence below demonstrates the strong outgassing from the

Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>Nice image!
<br>
<br>Now help me out. What do you mean when you say you "desaturated" the
<br>information?  I don't see how you can turn the clock back and take a
<br>shorter exposure to avoid saturation.  I understand the part about
<br>reducing the light levels, but once the pixels are at their maximum
<br>white, quantitative brightness information is lost and no amount of
<br>image processing can reclaim it.
<br>
<br>Anyway, whatever you did, it made for an excellent image!

Hello Dennis.  Long time no hear from!.  In PS the desaturate simply
<br>takes a color channel and removes the color.  When I transfer from
<br>CCDSoftV5 to PScs2 I save in color this way I can use the images in
<br>color or grayscale.

Hi at all,
<br>today I have update the italian web site of comet

<br>
<br>particularly one photo served as an Italian (P.Lazzarotti), specialized in hi-res,
<br>unbelievable
<br>
<br>the false nucleus is not round, but it resembles a pear. also me, this morning, in my

<br>
<br>are there recent images served as professional telescopes?

<br>By now you have all seen images and posts regarding comet 17P
<br>Holmes.  It is truly an amazing comet. In the space of just 14
<br>hours, the comet increased in brightness by 17 magnitudes -- that's
<br>a factor of six million times brighter (2.51^17) !  You can view it
<br>by naked eye, binoculars, or telescope. Imaging is easy because it
<br>is so bright.

<br>Here are a few links that I employ to scrounge up data on the comet

Hi Group

<br>This is a first time post for me although I've admired the images here

<br>Since the start of this outburst, the weather here has been dire -
<br>100% cloud so it was a great surprise to get an hour of clear weather
<br>last night enabling me to observe this wonderful sight. I have never
<br>seen anything like it before.
<br>

I just discovered this group and am enjoying all the images of comet
<br>17P.
<br>
<br>We had rain all last week here in southern Indiana, so I was unable to
<br>view 17P until early Sunday morning. I was impressed how easy it was to
<br>see with the naked eye, despite the nearby Moon. Here is a shot I took
<br>of it with my Televue 102iis refractor, 2X Televue Powermate, and Canon
<br>20Da DSLR:

Hello All, While I have certainly enjoyed the many images everyone had
<br>posted of 17P, and incidentally many are very nice, I was wondering if
<br>anyone knows if any "professional" observatories have taken an
<br>interest. Wouldn't you enjoy a Keck or Hubble image? I have been unable
<br>to find an answer. With all the mystery surrounding it's million fold
<br>brightening, I would think the professionals would be equally
<br>interested. Especially, since the nucleus is invisible. And, since the
<br>tail is obviously pointed directly away from us, I would love to know
<br>how long it is (though I realize that is probably impossible to
<br>determine).

Hello.  I understand that there are all different kinds of chips and
<br>each has it's own ability to record different colors.  In the past
<br>there was always a basic color a comet was putting out or actually 3
<br>different colors red, green & blue but Red was dust.  If this comet is
<br>reflecting a lot of dust around the central portion , where is the red
<br>and why is it yellow almost gold.  I haven't seen any red color from
<br>this comet.  My camera chip is not as strong in the red but I would

<br>Any takers?

Hello.  Same amount of information went into this image as yesterday.
<br>Less Moonlight and less humidity allowed a stronger color and less
<br>noise.  Central portion of the comet overexposed this image and leads
<br>me to beleive it is brighter in magnitude than yesterday.

Hi peeps...
<br>
<br>Finally the sky decided to clear up a little, and granted us a view of
<br>Comet Holmes!
<br>
<br>Using a 90mm Megrez Telescope the coma appeared less defined behind
<br>the "dust jet". Nucleus is extremely well defined... Will take a peek
<br>later in the night to note motion against background stars and maybe
<br>attempt some photos with less wind.
<br>
<br>Below is also my very modest attempt at capturing a photo of the comet:
<br>
<br>http://outdoors.webshots.com/photo/2456521170030728289pUVZUb
<br>
<br>It's a Single 15Sec shot with Nikon D80 on Hand-driven equatorial
<br>mount, using 90mm William Optics Megrez. ISO1600
<br>
<br>You can see it's badly tracked, but I'm happy to have recorded this
<br>little souvenir.
<br>
<br>I'm desperate to receive my CGE1400, hoping I can take at least
<br>"half-way decent" shots :o))  Fingers crossed maybe the comet remains
<br>like this at least through November.
<br>
<br>Clear Skies!

<br>Hi Mike,
<br>
<br>If by "streamers" you mean the finger-like structure like this
<br>http://www.klaas-
<br>jobse.net/cyclops/kometen/20071030_17P_11x12sUnsharp412_LS07.jpg
<br>
<br>also found here (shorter link)
<br>http://www.klaas-jobse.net/cyclops/cometspage.htm
<br>
<br>then the secret is unsharp mask!
<br>
<br>However, to bring them out, you need to meet two criteria:
<br>1) High statistics, 16-bit images  lots of images (~50 or so) in the
<br>stack, and
<br>2) Unsaturated sub frames  50% well depth on the brightest pixels
<br>
<br>Try a 5x5 mask, and rather aggressive parameter selection  you will
<br>probably get gross-looking ring artifacts  "halos"  but don't
<br>worry. You will bring out the underlying structure.
<br>
<br>Here's what I posted to the Comets-ML:
<br>
<br>Unsharp Masking artifacts vs. Real Morphology
<br>
<br>Whereas the more complicated radial gradient operators various
<br>imagers have applied are somewhat difficult to understand (for me,
<br>anyway!) in terms of artifact generation, unsharp masking (USM) is an
<br>edge operator, and as such, is incapable of producing streak
<br>artifacts, or the kind of structure we are seeing in current images.
<br>Aggressively applied, USM results in ring artifacts, or "halos",
<br>around the stars.
<br>
<br>Streak artifacts are radially disposed lines emanating from a high-
<br>frequency central point. The "fingers" or "streamers" that we see in
<br>nearly everyone's images are not all radially symmetric, and, as
<br>such, are neither streak artifacts nor edge artifacts. They are real
<br>underlying structure.
<br>
<br>Giovanni illustrated the application of USM for me on my images, and
<br>I later obtained similar a appearing structure myself by applying
<br>USM. Alan Watson and Carl Hergenrother both have processed my images
<br>by other more sophisticated, independent techniques and both obtained
<br>identical looking structures.
<br>
<br>It should be noted that these results can only be obtained on a high-
<br>statistics, unsaturated images. I transformed my 16-bit FITs image
<br>into an 8-bit JPG and the USM merely produced random noise and ring
<br>artifacts.
<br>
<br>I submit that the images presented to the list indicate that the
<br>structure is real.
<br>
<br>The question for discussion is, what is it and what causes it?

<br>Hello Dennis.  The images I took ranged form 2 seconds to 60 seconds
<br>each depending on which night I imaged.  A total of the clear
<br>unfiltered images totaled 10 minutes in 60 second individual images.
<br>These were not used as the pix bleed overpowered the entire center of
<br>the comet.  I also took RG&B images of 1x40 second exposures in a set
<br>of 5x60 second images total for each channel.  These were all processed
<br>in as many ways including each way you said.  In none of the final
<br>images did I find what was refered to as streamers or a tail. Now---as
<br>I said this does not in any way mean there are not streamers or a faint
<br>tail.  I see no reason there would not be a tail-tails.  My equipment
<br>did not record it.  I see no reason for the tail to not be there as it
<br>was there before the outburst per images by Josef Mueller -
<br>http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/Comet-Images/message/3364  Hopefully
<br>I will image the tail with my equipment as it grows and brightens.
<br>Good luck with your imaging
<br>Mike H.

Arkansas Sky Observatory (H45) update on Comet 17P:
<br>Comet imaged and measured as high cirrus moved in.
<br>New photo showing expansion of comet:
<br>http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=1429.msg6902#msg6902
<br>The comet maintains both brightness and physical attributes; morphology has not
<br>appreciably changed, but again the overall diameter continues to grow at an
<br>extraordinary rate.
<br>Coma overall diameter = 596" arc (CCD) with increasingly bright offset bright segment to
<br>SW of nucleus - in PA 214, now extending to 69.5"" from nucleus, up from previous dates
<br>Coma appears considerably larger to the naked eye, perhaps as much as 17-20 arc minutes
<br>Magnitude, m1 = 2.1, slightly brighter than previous night, very distinct cloud to the
<br>naked eye with conspicuous nebulosity and yellow color; comparison star (naked eye) is
<br>Alpha Per
<br>Nuclear magnitude, m2 = 11.1, continues to drop rapidly as the nucleus becomes even more
<br>pinpoint
<br>
<br>Overall color remains the same, very golden yellow throughout all expanses of the comet.
<br>
<br>Equipment: 0.4m SCT @ f/3 CCD, ST402-ME C-I CCD, RGB @ 8 seconds.  Overall magnitude

Nice image.
<br>
<br>A question.... While this image appears to show extended structure from the comet - what
<br>is the cause of the structures surrounding the brighter stars? Is it diffraction spikes
<br>from a secondary support, or something else? The bright star to the left of the comet (in

Hi Dave
<br>hi dave
<br>
<br>the instrument is a deltagraph (NO secondary mirror).
<br>a  4" corrector  (three lens) is mounted in the tubus on three points. therfore the ccd-camera is housed in the tubus too.
<br>maybe some stars are deformed, as a effect of antiblooming.
<br>but there is no connection beetween stars images and
<br>comets tail.

Hello all !
<br>
<br>Yesterday I shot Holmes with my Portaball Newton 12.5" at f5. Camera
<br>used was a Lumenera 075m. Interesting structures were recorded
<br>(wavelet filters in Registax). More info you could found under the image.

Dear all,
<br>yesterday finally the weather cleared up and I've capured some images of
<br>the comet with my 30cm f/2.0 Schmidt Camera. As many others have noted,
<br>the comet show a very fain tail, I've measured that the main component
<br>is at PA 210° and a secondary tail is at PA 245°, extending from the
<br>optocenter respectively about 32' and 26'. Many other filaments seems to
<br>be present, as can be evidenced with a highly overprocessed blue frame.
<br>The dust coma is 10' diameter and the gas coma is about 33'.
<br>
<br>It would be interesting to compare the (quantitative) line profile of
<br>the comet between the two dates below.

Dear all,
<br>
<br>this my estimation of this evening:
<br>
<br>Comet 17P/Holmes
<br>2007 Nov. 01.85 UT: m1=2.1, Dia=15', DC=7.... NE......T. Scarmato (Calabria,
<br>Italy)
<br>
<br>Also, I have updated my home page of 17P.  My last image show the complex structures that I saw in the last day on several images.
<br>Look like that in this case the filter Larson-Sekanina is able to put in evidence this details in the coma of 17P, also if the unsharping is sufficient to see the structure.

<br>Arkansas Sky Observatory (H45) update on Comet 17P for November 2
<br>
<br>Comet imaged in moonless skies, high cirrus clouds
<br>The comet maintains both brightness and physical attributes; morphology has not
<br>appreciably changed, but again the overall diameter continues to grow at an
<br>extraordinary rate.  Coma is now somewhat of a bluish hue with a tint of yellow.
<br>Coma overall diameter = 638" arc (CCD) with increasingly bright offset bright segment as
<br>well as possible tail to
<br>SW of nucleus - in PA 214, now extending to 88.5"" from nucleus, up from previous dates.
<br>This inner condensed portion of the coma extends 183" arc from the nucleus, and is
<br>surrounded by a symmetrical very dark circle, or void, that is located uniformly 202"
<br>arc from the nucleus, surrounding the inner coma like a large "inner tube"
<br>
<br>Coma appears considerably larger to the naked eye, perhaps as much as 20 arc minutes
<br>Magnitude, m1 = 2.0, slightly brighter than previous night, very distinct cloud to the
<br>naked eye with conspicuous nebulosity and NOW LESS yellow color; comparison star (naked
<br>eye) is
<br>Alpha Per
<br>Nuclear magnitude, m2 = 11.6, continues to drop rapidly as the nucleus becomes even more
<br>pinpoint
<br>
<br>Overall color remains the same, very golden yellow throughout all expanses of the comet.
<br>
<br>Equipment: 0.4m SCT @ f/3 CCD, ST402-ME C-I CCD, RGB @ 8 seconds.  Overall magnitude
<br>estimate via naked eye, Alpha Peg. by comparison

Dear all.
<br>
<br>That is my observation.
<br>
<br>Comet 17P/Holmes in outburst
<br>2007 11 02.83, 1.9, 20', (T.Scarmato, Calabria, Italy, naked eye)
<br>Clearly more active since yesterday night, at naked eye the comet show a
<br>bright coma and a central condensation diffuse (DC=7),
<br>in 25 cm Newton f/4.8 at 48x the ions tail is visible for about 0.5 deg with
<br>some filaments. Also the outer green coma is faint but visible.
<br>In the central zone I was able to detect some peculiar structure clarly
<br>visible in my sum of 100x30 sec image taken on 2007 11 02 19:06:03 UT with
<br>25 cm newtonian and CCD+Rc filter.  The brigther 4 structures are in PA=220

<br>about why Holmes does not have a tail
<br>
<br>"But where's the comet's tail? Like any good comet, Holmes' tail would tend
<br>to point away from the Sun.
<br> That direction is nearly along our line-of-sight behind the comet, making
<br>its tail very difficult to see."

<br>> Yesterday I shot Holmes with my Portaball Newton 12.5" at f5. Camera
<br>> used was a Lumenera 075m. Interesting structures were recorded
<br>> (wavelet filters in Registax). More info you could found under the image.

<br>> 4. Animation of coma growth: 17P Holmes from ASO
<br>>     Posted by: "P. Clay Sherrod" drclay@tcworks.net drclay2002
<br>>     Date: Wed Oct 31, 2007 11:28 am ((PDT))
<br>>
<br>> Provided is a series of ASO images from Oct. 26, 27, 29, 30, and 31 that
<br>> show the
<br>> remarkable explosion/expansion of the coma of comet 17P Holmes.
<br>> The images are all at exactly the same scale (the field is about 6 arc
<br>> minutes square)
<br>> on each night and show the very rapid and dramatic growth of this unheralded
<br>> event.
<br>> http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=1437.0
<br>>
<br>> This may well be the most unique and impressive comet that we will ever see
<br>> in our
<br>> lifetimes and is currently very easy to see naked eye about 10 p.m. local
<br>> time.
<br>>
<br>> Images are from the ASO 0.4m SCT at f/3, CCD, all 5 seconds RGB.
<br>>
<br>> Much thanks to ASO Forum contributor Ron Wayman for this work in providing
<br>> this fine
<br>> animation.

Hi all,
<br>
<br>C/2007F1 (LONEOS) is just starting to appear in the southern skies. I imaged it last night in the late twilight as it was only a few degrees above the SW horizon. I imaged it with a Canon 10D DSLR camera and 41cm (16") f4.5 Newtonian. 8 x 1 minute subs @ 800ISO. I photographed it on Saturday 3.33 November 2007 (UT). Visually I could see a faint tail with an 8cm refractor...

UPDATE November 4 - Latest Image at
<br>http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=1429.msg6902#msg6902
<br>Arkansas Sky Observatory (H45) update on Comet 17P:
<br>Comet imaged in moonless skies, high cirrus clouds
<br>The comet has decreased slightly in brightness, both total and nuclear  morphology has
<br>not
<br>appreciably changed, but again the overall diameter continues to grow at an
<br>extraordinary rate.
<br>Coma overall diameter = 832" arc (CCD) with increasingly bright offset bright segment as
<br>well as possible tail to
<br>SW of nucleus - in PA 216, the previous very bright "knot" of concentration has lessened
<br>drastically over the past 72 hours.
<br>Coma appears very large and distinct to the naked eye, perhaps as much as 20 arc minutes
<br>Magnitude, m1 = 2.4, (naked eye) noticeably dimmer than previous night, very distinct
<br>cloud to the
<br>naked eye with conspicuous nebulosity and yellow color; comparison star (naked eye) is
<br>Alpha Per
<br>Nuclear magnitude, m2 = 12.2, continues to drop rapidly as the nucleus becomes even more
<br>pinpoint
<br>
<br>Overall color remains the same, very golden yellow throughout all expanses of the comet.
<br>
<br>Equipment: 0.4m SCT @ f/3 CCD, ST402-ME C-I CCD, RGB @ 8 seconds.  Overall magnitude
<br>estimate via naked eye, Alpha Peg. by comparison

UPDATE November 5 - Latest Image is posted at:
<br>http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=1429.msg6902#msg6902
<br>Arkansas Sky Observatory (H45) update on Comet 17P:
<br>Comet imaged in moonless skies, haze and poor conditions
<br>The comet has maintained steady brightness, both total and nuclear  morphology has not
<br>appreciably changed, and although the coma appears to be attaining a more uniformly
<br>spread intensity and density, the size has increased only slightly.
<br>Coma overall diameter = 838" arc (CCD) with increasingly bright offset bright segment as
<br>well as possible tail to
<br>SW of nucleus - in PA 216, the previous very bright "knot" of concentration has lessened
<br>drastically over the past 72 hours.
<br>Coma appears very large and distinct to the naked eye, perhaps as much as 20 arc minutes
<br>Magnitude, m1 = 2.4, (naked eye) nearly equal to previous night, very distinct cloud to
<br>the
<br>naked eye with conspicuous nebulosity and NOW appears to be losing the previous distinct
<br>yellow color; comparison star (naked eye) is Alpha Per
<br>Nuclear magnitude, m2 = 12.4, continues to drop rapidly as the nucleus becomes even more
<br>pinpoint
<br>
<br>NOTE that astrometry continues to place the very starlike nucleus at very nearly precise
<br>to the predicted (MPC) center position of this comet, with very little offset since its
<br>original outburst.
<br>
<br>Overall color is nearly colorless, with slight yellow tint, throughout all expanses of
<br>the comet.
<br>
<br>Equipment: 0.4m SCT @ f/3 CCD, ST402-ME C-I CCD, RGB @ 8 seconds.  Overall magnitude
<br>estimate via naked eye, Alpha Peg. by comparison

Dear All,
<br>
<br>Last night I tried to image comet 17P. I used the main unit
<br>available at the Virtual Telescope, based on a C14@f/9
<br>(scale: 0.58"/pixel) + SBIG ST8-XME + Paramount ME.
<br>
<br>30 images, each 60 sec. long were used to finally get this:
<br>
<br>http://virtualtelescope.bellatrixobservatory.org/17p_4nov07.jpg
<br>
<br>Seeing was quite good: 1.5/2.0".
<br>
<br>I tried to keep the image processing as much gentle as
<br>possible. While the inner structures can be shown at their
<br>full strength, I decided to handle them carefully.
<br>
<br>Clear skies,
<br>Gianluca

Interesting aspect of the core of this comet; the scanning densitometer gradient (right)
<br>extends a full 208 arc seconds in P.A. 216, the same as the developing straight tail or
<br>ejection from the central nucleus of 17P Holmes.  Note that the densitometry reveals
<br>that the core has a uniform gradient, but that the gradient is centered on what "was"
<br>the bright ejection mass that was some 65" arc from the nucleus on Nov. 3.

<br>This monochrome image is 2 seconds to show the features within the core only, taken with
<br>the 0.4m SCT at H45 Petit Jean Mountain South of Arkansas Sky Observatory, by P. Clay
<br>Sherrod.
<br>The nucleus on Nov. 5 at 04:40 UT was magnitude 12.4, the total size of the coma (not
<br>seen to its entire extent in this image) was 838 arc seconds, with the developing tail
<br>in position angle 216 deg.

<br>a comet imaging conference---count me in!  I will start saving money
<br>for the airfair.
<br>  This image was inspired by something I did last night.  I looked up.
<br>For the first time in a long time I got out the binoculars and a 12:00
<br>midnight our time I looked at this comet.  Normally I only see what the
<br>computer shows me.  I then took 10 minutes each of RG&B filtered
<br>images.  Stacked on the false nuk of the comet and did a combine.
<br>There was no color or levels processing.  a mild sharp was done and
<br>this was the result.  It also shows the faint green around the outer
<br>edge.  Stand back and take a look.
<br>Thanks, Mike H.

<br>>
<br>> Last night I tried to image comet 17P. I used the main

<br>> Seeing was quite good: 1.5/2.0".

<br>> possible. While the inner structures can be shown at their
<br>> full strength, I decided to handle them carefully.
<br>>
<br>> Clear skies,

<br>Please see:  http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=1429.0  for daily updates, Oct.
<br>25 through Nov. 5
<br>
<br>Arkansas Sky Observatory (H45) update on Comet 17P:
<br>Comet imaged in moonless skies, fair conditions
<br>The comet has maintained steady brightness, both total and nuclear  morphology has not
<br>appreciably changed, and the overall size of the coma has grown considerably, as has the
<br>developing tail emerged vividly in P.A. 219 deg.
<br>Coma overall diameter = 11.3' arc (CCD) with increasingly bright offset bright segment
<br>as well as possible tail to
<br>SW of nucleus - in PA 219, the previous very bright "knot" of concentration has lessened
<br>drastically over the past 72 hours.
<br>Coma appears very large and distinct to the naked eye, perhaps as much as 25 arc minutes
<br>Magnitude, m1 = 2.4, (naked eye) nearly equal to previous night, very distinct cloud to
<br>the
<br>naked eye with conspicuous nebulosity and NOW appears to have totally lost the previous
<br>distinct yellow color; comparison star (naked eye) is Alpha Per
<br>Nuclear magnitude, m2 = 12.4, continues to drop rapidly as the nucleus becomes even more
<br>pinpoint
<br>
<br>Overall color is nearly colorless, with slight yellow tint, throughout all expanses of
<br>the comet.
<br>NOTE that the updated image at the end of the ASO sequence here, is in MONOCHROME size
<br>there is very little hue of color to the coma at this time.
<br>
<br>Equipment: 0.4m SCT @ f/3 CCD, ST402-ME C-I CCD, RGB @ 8 seconds.  Overall magnitude
<br>estimate via naked eye, Alpha Per. by comparison.

Hello.  On the 6th information was taken at 2 different times.  The
<br>previous image posted was from the later session which was 2 minute
<br>exposures.  This image is from the 40 second images and I used blue
<br>filtered images for the lum. channel.  Once again I have not gone for
<br>tail(s) but I am looking more for where the ion gas starts.  I also
<br>worked on the false nuk and the bubble effects in the center of the

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">

<br>A couple of night agao I took images of comet Holmes that show what I
<br>believe are part of the dust tail from the comet. As you can see
<br>below I took Lunimance images using an IR filter instead of Clear to
<br>try to bring out this detai.
<br>
<br>To view the images go to www.sierrastars.com/gp/What's_New.aspx. The
<br>seeing andtransparency were good so I wanted to see how much detail I
<br>could image ofthe potential dust in the tail and in the coma. The
<br>images are 30 minuteLRGB total exposures were the Luminance data
<br>comes from an Infrared filter.
<br>
<br>Exposure times were:
<br>
<br>I = 30 x 30 seconds
<br>
<br>B, V, R = 10 x 30 seconds each filter
<br>
<br>Experimenting with the various filters I found that I could get most
<br>detail using IR for the Luminance than a straight full spectrum
<br>Luminance. You can make out subtle detail in the image. One of the
<br>images has no image processing other than combining the color
<br>composite while I used an FFT high band pass filter the other image
<br>to try to bring out detail using that technique. I tracked on the
<br>comet and stacked the images on the nucleus therefore you can see
<br>some separation in the field stars. It seems that the comet is slowly
<br>turning from coming almost straight on (or away) from our
<br>point of view.  This is quite an amazing serendipitous event and a
<br>lot of fun to follow!

Hello
<br>  I was not going to post information from last night untill I saw the
<br>image Rolado linked and I knew then that there really wasn't any tail
<br>in my images and I knew why.  I just figured something had gone haywire
<br>or something.  This image is a 38x40 second exposure with a stack on
<br>the comet and median combine.  Applied a histrogram and no other
<br>processing.  The other two are the same image except turned negative.
<br>IWe all have seen the tail structure over the past week or so and this
<br>is what I was after.  I am not sure if or where the other structure
<br>running parallel comes from or if it is real.

<br>
<br>I went out 3 days (11/1, 11/5, 11/7).  On 11/7 I also got in a closeup shot of the nucleus
<br>w/jet.  I also found a new observation area, there are some nice panoramic views of the
<br>comet w/Milky Way.  I observed 3 neg magnitude meteors..very memorable.  1 had a red
<br>nucleus, that left a persistent-trail.
<br>
<br>It was really beautiful in the mountains, I did some 4x4'ing afterwards.  Bad weather until
<br>about Monday.
<br>
<br>Has anyone noticed any weakening of the comet?

UPDATE November 10 - Latest Image at http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=1450.0
<br>Arkansas Sky Observatory (H45) update on Comet 17P:  Fine tail structure developing near
<br>nucleus
<br>Comet imaged in moonless skies, good conditions
<br>The comet has decreased total brightness, both total and nuclear  as coma continues
<br>expansion;
<br>appreciably changed, and the overall size of the coma has grown considerably, as has the
<br>developing tail emerged vividly in P.A. 209 deg.
<br>with at least one parallel secondary tail seen in negative inset image.
<br>Coma overall diameter = 11.3' arc (CCD)
<br>Coma appears very large and distinct to the naked eye, perhaps as much as 25 arc minutes
<br>Magnitude, m1 = 2.9, (naked eye) nearly equal to previous night, very distinct cloud to
<br>the
<br>naked eye with conspicuous nebulosity and NOW appears to have totally lost the previous
<br>distinct yellow color; comparison star (naked eye) is Alpha Per
<br>Nuclear magnitude, m2 = 13.5, continues to drop rapidly as the nucleus becomes even more
<br>pinpoint
<br>
<br>Overall color is now somewhat blue.
<br>
<br>Equipment: 0.4m SCT @ f/3 CCD, ST402-ME C-I CCD, RGB @ 40 RGB seconds.  Overall
<br>magnitude
<br>estimate via naked eye, Alpha Per. by comparison.

UPDATE November 12 - Latest Image at
<br>http://www.arksky.org/smf/index.php?topic=1450.msg7019#msg7019
<br>Arkansas Sky Observatory (H45) update on Comet 17P:
<br>Comet imaged in moonless skies, good conditions, perhaps last opportunity before moon
<br>interferes
<br>The comet has continued to decrease in total brightness, both total and nuclear  as coma
<br>continues expansion;
<br>Physical morphology NOT appreciably changed, and the overall size of the coma has grown
<br>only slight in past few days, developing tail streamers vividly in P.A. 209 deg.
<br>with several parallel secondary tails seen in negative inset image.
<br>Coma overall diameter = 15.9' arc (CCD)
<br>Coma appears very large and distinct to the naked eye, perhaps as much as 25 arc minutes
<br>Magnitude, m1 = 2.9, (naked eye) nearly equal to previous night, very distinct cloud to
<br>the
<br>naked eye with conspicuous nebulosity and NOW appears to have totally lost the previous
<br>distinct yellow color; comparison star (naked eye) is Alpha Per
<br>Nuclear magnitude, m2 = 13.6, continues to drop rapidly as the nucleus becomes even more
<br>pinpoint
<br>
<br>Overall color is now colorless, but somewhat blue.
<br>
<br>Equipment: 0.4m SCT @ f/3 CCD, ST402-ME C-I CCD, RGB @ 40 RGB seconds.  Overall
<br>magnitude
<br>estimate via naked eye, Alpha Per. by comparison

Hello List
<br>
<br>I have been quite happy with my images for several nights showing the
<br>yellowish inner coma and turquoise blue/green outer coma which seemed
<br>consistent with many other images.
<br>
<br>However, the past two nights have produced images with a distinct
<br>yellowy/red inner coma! I have been processing all my images in
<br>virtually the same way, and using the same camera (ST10 CCD camera
<br>with RGB filters).
<br>
<br>The majority of images that I have seen taken with a dSLR are showing
<br>either a blue inner coma or a colourless (silvery/white) inner coma.
<br>
<br>Am I experiencing problems with my filters or is there some rational
<br>explanation? Maybe it has to do with the colour response of dSLR
<br>cameras in general...
<br>
<br>As an example:

I can only give my 2 cents here.
<br>  I try to follow one rule.  Process your background and set your
<br>stars to the real color.  Doing this and not overprocessing will put
<br>the comet close.  You may not like it but if your stars are true the
<br>comet must follow.  You can't depend on images that are designed to
<br>show outer faint aspects of the comet.  This doesn't mean they are
<br>incorrect just that inhancing the faint blows out the brighter
<br>parts.  Remembering there are no pink stars or green stars or all
<br>stars can't be blue will only help you.

Mike,
<br>
<br>An unmodified DSLR with its broadband color filters should give the
<br>most "natural" shots unless the comet has some emission lines that
<br>fall into dips in the response curves (like the problem of OIII with
<br>many films), but the main problem is everyone is processing the images
<br>differently.  I've seen white, yellow, green, and purple versions of
<br>the comet!

<br>I'm posting from Anza Borrego (using my mobile satellite-DSL dish on my 4x4 van).  I just
<br>returned from the 40th anniversary Baja 1000.  I was doing double-duty: LIVE race-coverage
<br>& iTunes video-podcast coverage of the race (daytime) & nighttime astrophoto of Comet
<br>Holmes.
<br>
<br>My wide-angle photos don't seem to be picking up any ion tail, is this what everyone else is
<br>getting.  When I return home, I can develop the TP2415 film images from 8" f1.5 Schmidt-

Mike,
<br>
<br>Yes, I think you're looking a a small string of stars.  And the frame
<br>top is slightly canted towards the NW, by the way.  Keep those
<br>detailed images of the the head coming.  It seems that's where the
<br>major action is happening.  I think the outer structures are going to

Hi Dave,
<br>
<br>I probably should have clipped the edges of the image more. Due to
<br>stacking, some of the stars in the upper left hand corner are green
<br>due to the fact that the other colors are missing. Otherwise in the
<br>main areas of the image, I tried hard to achieve a good color

<br>Coma overall diameter = 13.9' arc (CCD)
<br>Coma appears very large and now is very diffuse and difficult to the naked eye,
<br>estimated at about 22 arc minutes
<br>Magnitude, m1 = 3.4, (naked eye) very difficult and large to the naked eye, colorless
<br>and NOW appears to have totally lost the previous distinct yellow color; comparison star
<br>(naked eye) is Alpha Per
<br>Nuclear magnitude, m2 = 14.2, continues to drop rapidly as the nucleus becomes even more
<br>pinpoint
<br>
<br>Overall color is now colorless, and therefore this image is has been taken in
<br>monochrome.
<br>
<br>Equipment: 0.4m SCT @ f/3 CCD, ST402-ME C-I CCD, 50 seconds.  Overall magnitude
<br>estimate via naked eye, Alpha Per. by comparison.

<br>Comet Holmes has lessened in brightness but still great in scopes and binocs.
<br>It is still quite large around the diameter of moon angular wise. I think it
<br>is around 5 mag or so.
<br>My pics and more coming at
<br>http://eoas-dreric1kansas.blogspot.com/
<br> In the sky you can also see the following other Broughton, Lovas, Tuttle and
<br>Linear Mueller.
<br>You need a good scope for these. They are fainter and don't have much of
<br>way of tails. So they are more difficult to find. Lovas in particular looks like
<br>a nebulous little ball.
<br>I will post pics when I can in the future.

Hello Group,
<br>I am in the process of putting together my club's newsletter for
<br>December and I am looking for recent images of 8P Tuttle to include in
<br>an article I am writing. The article includes finder charts and images
<br>of both 17P Holmes and 8P Tuttle along with at litte history about each
<br>comet. If I use an image provided by you I will send you a copy (pdf
<br>format) of the issue. I like to include as much image info as possible
<br>so please try to provide.
<br>Thank you in advance.

The outburst has NOT changed any orbital parameters of the comet, at least on the short
<br>term; we have kept monitoring astrometrically the nucleus of the comet since the initial
<br>outburst and there appears to be absolutely no shift from the parameters that were in
<br>place prior to the event.

Hello.  This is a 25x40 sec exp.  After working on my setup I couldn't
<br>figure out which way was N by compairing software and the image.  I was
<br>seeing faint tail structure in the N/E position if N is up which would
<br>be correct.  If N is down then I don't know what is what.  Sometimes
<br>things just go that way I guess.  This is composed of 13 images
<br>unfiltered through a clear non-IR blocking filter and 12 through rgb
<br>with IR-block filters.  Shows the difference in star bloat.  Comet is
<br>on the verge of looking really nice and is moving a lot faster than the
<br>last time I imaged it a month ago.

<br>For some time now we have been seeing these 3 lines in the tail.  The center line traces back to the left side of the comets head, but the other 2 lines trace back to a point on either side of the head, out in the middle of nowhere.
<br>
<br>Looking at the image I uploaded here, there seems to be some concentrated spots at 1 o'clock and 9 o'clock from the head of the comet.
<br>What are these?  Jets? Fragments?
<br>
<br>With the Jets answer, I see (or imagine) a spiral coming off each side of the head of the comet.Actually the one at 1 o'clock looks like an ion tail.

<br>Absolutely stunning! What amazes me is that your image shows all the
<br>structures that are visible faintly with binoculars...just enhanced
<br>and more apparent PLUS. The representation is fabulous...I remember
<br>just a few years ago the images just did not match what was
<br>attainable visually.  The structure that is visible is not lost in
<br>over-exposure, but instead it is wonderfully enhanced.  Michael
<br>Jaeger's images are incredible too...well done both of you. Your
<br>previous images with Alpha Pegasi in the coma are also fantastic!  I
<br>just hope that there is still room for those of us who like to
<br>sketch!!!

Please excuse my excitement...it's been cloudy here since mid November.  Is
<br>it my imagination or is 17P about half the size of the full Moon (naked

<br>
<br>I haven't had time to view though the scope but naked eye it's very large.

<br>Yeah, after learning how, I measured the diameter of 17P twice:
<br>
<br>11/3/2007 it was 656,820 miles
<br>http://www.flickr.com/photos/quarkcsj/1886770688/in/set-72157602205443426/
<br>
<br>and
<br>
<br>11/16/2007 it was 1,287,640 Miles
<br>http://www.flickr.com/photos/quarkcsj/2036582711/in/set-72157602297783012/
<br>
<br>I imaged it recently and it barely fit in my 8" SCT with a 6.3 Focal Reducer.
<br>FL 2000mm f/10 X 0.63 = FL 1260mm f/6.3

Hi at all.
<br>
<br>to these addresses you can see a sequence of images of the comet 17P sorts all with the
<br>same setup in remote with the system Rent A Scope from the NM (USA):
<br>
<br>http://comete.uai.it/17p/17P_071118.jpg

<br>the last, made this morning, show the comet next to the Ngc1245
<br>
<br>in the image of this morning (total 50min) with high contrast
<br>
<br>http://comete.uai.it/17p/17P_071204_hc.jpg
<br>
<br>I have measured a coma of 70'x130', equal to a dimension of
<br>5600000x10300000 km, is this correct?
<br>
<br>always on this image she is seen a structure that is cut by the comet:
<br>is it an already present nebulosity or the comet is passing above to the
<br>residue of the tail of ions of beginning November?

<br>
<br>you excuse me.
<br>checking with the catalog DSS, I have verified that nebulosity is

Rolando.  Very nice!  Hubble was aimed at 8P on the 4th of Dec (I
<br>think).  Always good to try for images at the same time or close in

<br>Lately they are at home for convalescence, for this I am using different
<br>telescopes of the system GRAS in NM (http://www.global-rent-a-scope.com/)
<br>
<br>for the 8P photo I have used the system G3 that is constituted by an apo
<br>TOA 150/852 with ccd ST10Xme, and I have used these times:
<br>LBVR= 4x120sec each.
<br>however I have to say that the quality of the sky is notable.
<br>certain particular weak I succeed them in photographing only under that sky.
<br>
<br>here, where we have us the observatory these skies them we can dream only ;-((((

<br>The information for the images was listed on the B&W image.  I took the
<br>color information which was 3x40 seconds each for RG&B filtered images
<br>just after the lum information was taken.  Even at this short time
<br>movement was an issue.  Working on a 7 frame mosaic of 17p from last

Hello.  Was wondering about the images that were attempted.  Received

<br>This is part of the mail.
<br>Thanks, Mike
<br>
<br>"Dear Mike,
<br>    Spitzer is too sensitive to infrared emission to image the comet. I
<br>took spectra of the infrared emission, and that worked very well. I
<br>did also use the small peakup camera on the spectrograph to attempt
<br>an image, but the result was completely saturated. So as a result I
<br>have only the set of spectra. The comet was so bright that the
<br>spectra are of very high quality, among the best ever taken. If you
<br>want to spread this word, please feel free. There was a short and
<br>very nice article in the Sky&Tel online about 17P that includes my
<br>quotes on the Spitzer spectra.
<br>Cheers,
<br>Bill"

 17P Holmes.  It seems like 17P has elongated since last week. At the
<br>eyepiece it looks as though a tail is  trying to extend from the coma.
<br> My observing partner (David Crum) and I observed comet 8P Tuttle in my
<br>10" and his 16" scopes both last week and last night. The comet has
<br>gained about 3 mags. from about 11.5 to about 8.5mag.No tail was
<br>evident however. I think I saw a stellar looking core.

<div style="maxwidth:1000px;font-family:Lucida Console,Monaco,monospace;font-size:small">
I have started a new blog to feature photos of comet observations.
<br>Comet Observers Blog
<br>http://cometobservers.blogspot.com/
<br>
<br>In 2001, I created the Comets Observer's Award for the Astronomical League.
<br>Since then amateurs have gained silver and/or gold certificates and pins for
<br>the achievements. This blog will showcase photos of comets by those who have
<br>achieved   the Comets Observer's Awards, those in process for the award as well
<br>other amateur astronomers who have photographed with CCD images, regular
<br>photos or sketched comets. This is an ongoing effort to post photos of recent comet
<br>and encourage working towards the award(s).
<br>
<br>I will attempt to post the best images of comets that I and others capture
<br>through regular photos, ccd imaging or sketches (scanned jpeg).   Observation/
<br>photographs by other are welcome. My hope is more amateurs will begin and try
<br>to achieve the silver or gold comet awards.
<br>
<br>Send only your best.
<br>I am looking for different images of various comets and photos. I can't post
<br>all that arrive but I will do my best. ATTACH photo and include:(1) Name,
<br>where you shot the comet; (2) your email address; (3) ccd/ reg photo/ sketch info;
<br>(4) exposure, f stop camera info etc etc; (5) include "I (add your name) have
<br>permission to use this image on the Comet Observers Blog" ; (6) all photos
<br>are copyrighted by original author and will not be used in any other way by Dr.
<br>Flescher unless permission granted.
<br>
<br>More information about the comet award at
<br>http://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/comet/comet.htm
<br>
<br>? let me know. I look forward to hearing from you-all.

The skies were really crappy, 4 out of 5, LOTS of moisture, lots of
<br>clouds, we were shooting through the sucker holes all night, but a few
<br>of us did manage to get some decent looks at Tuttle.
<br>
<br>It has become much brighter since last week (Dec 1st).  The core is
<br>much brighter and the coma more pronounced (unless it was the moisture
<br>causing some problems, lol)  It was very easily seen through my 16 LB,
<br>26mm Nagler.
<br>
<br>My observing partner found it very easily through his 10 inch Dob as
<br>well, views were a bit dimmer.

<br>Yes, the fast f ratio is incredible and very nice for imaging fast moving
<br>comets.
<br>The Canon 350D chip is a nice match to the corrected field of the
<br>Astrograph.
<br>I just did some imaging as it was dark here two hours ago, but there was a
<br>lot of moisture in the air.
<br>So I don't think the results will be better than yesterday.

Hi James,
<br>
<br>I forgot to tell about the magnitudes. To record faint stars, you need a
<br>longer focal length,this Astrograph is about 560mm fl.
<br>My telescope is ideal for nebulous objects because of its speed.
<br>
<br>In my M51 image I got to about 20 from my back garden in two hours.

<br>Yes.  I used a 400mm f/5 and a Canon 300D.  Sorry I didn't get the specs up yet, I plan on processing it further.  But this was over the light pollution of Honolulu, so it would be a lot better from a dark location.

<br>This will give you an idea of the condition in which I shot this.
<br>
<br>I used an Orion ShortTube 80mm f/5 400mm FL and a Canon Digital Rebel 300D, 30 second exposures @ ISO 400.
<br>
<br>The light pollution was too bad down that low, so I used ISO 400 for 8P and ISO 800 for 17P.

Hello.
<br>  Imaging comets is the hardest thing in the world.  Direction, speed,
<br>location, weather and all things make this true.  If you don't take an
<br>image at the correct time on a specific night, it is lost and unlike
<br>deep space objects will be lost forever.  I have always thought that
<br>personal stuff and business was something that needed to be kept
<br>seperate but this time I will break my own rule and say that to the
<br>best group of comet imagers in the world
<br> MERRY CHRISTMAS!  You are without a doubt the best and special group
<br>of imagers and deserve only the best so take care and whatever you do
<br>keep your scopes busy imaging that which we all love and learning that
<br>which we don't already know.       Cheers!!!!

Hello Rolando,
<br>
<br>Thanks!
<br>
<br>I like the ASA Astrograph very much! I use my ASA at home on a mobile G11
<br>(tripod, not on a pier).
<br>It is almost permanently set up in my observatory but during the holidays I
<br>take it with me to darker skies in the south of France.
<br>There are some pictures of the setup on my webpage.
<br>
<br>BTW: In a few weeks I will upgrade to an Italian made 10Micron mount! I'm
<br>looking forward to it!
<br>
<br>Collimation is quite easy after some practise, I use CatsEye collimation
<br>tools. You can collimate very precisely with the autocollimation eyepiece.
<br>But the ASA keeps collimation quite well, even after transport in a car.
<br>
<br>I don't know how long delivery time is at the moment, mine is over a year
<br>old now.
<br>You can ask Gerald Rehmann gerald.rhemann@astrosysteme.at about this
<br>
<br>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all on this list!

Comet 29P Schwassmann-Wachmann - December 9th 2007
<br>
<br>Distance 5.0317 AU (752.7 million km) - magnitude 15.3
<br>
<br>Comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann, or Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, was
<br>discovered on 15 November 1925 by Arnold Schwassmann and Arno Arthur
<br>Wachmann at the Hamburg Observatory.
<br>
<br>The comet is unusual in that while usually around magnitude 16, it
<br>sometimes suddenly brightens to  magnitude 12. For this reason the
<br>comet is well worth monitoring on a regular basis by amateur
<br>astronomers.

<br>Hi Michael, Hi Dave.
<br>
<br>you are right, I have forgotten to write the used setup,
<br>in practice I have used an old lens canon FD from 50mm f1,8s closed to f4
<br>and like ccd the SXVM25C.
<br>I hoped that closing of 1-2 stops I would have reduced the problem of the coma...
<br>the stars hear again some problem instead.
<br>this morning with more calm I try to improve the quality of the color, have too quickly
<br>elaborated last night the images and is seen! ;-)))

<br>Very nice image! I have been clouded out here for more than a week now.

<br>
<br>> Dear All,
<br>>
<br>> I have a couple of images of this comet to share. Details
<br>> are on the same pictures.

<br>>
<br>> The next image is from Dec. 28: the tail is clearly
<br>> visible:

<br>>
<br>http://virtualtelescope.bellatrixobservatory.org/8p_28dec07.jpg
<br>>
<br>> Note: I used the paramount ME tracking feature and it
<br>> worked great, also assuming the high-res of the images
<br>> (0.58"/pixel). It looks like a movie is worth to be done
<br>> :)
<br>>
<br>> Cheers,

Hi Charles,
<br>
<br>thanks for your comments. Yes, I'm pretty sure that
<br>structure is real. I managed to process also my 27 Dec.
<br>images with the same technique, getting this result:
<br>
<br>http://virtualtelescope.bellatrixobservatory.org/8p_27dec07_ls.jpg
<br>
<br>The same features were visible, possibly fainter (but the

<br>
<br>a strong structure is seen (jet?) to PA 220 (on 27/12) and PA 280 (on 28/12)
<br>in this last image a strange arc is noticed to also depart from the false nucleus,
<br>but I would not like that she was created by the filter LS.
<br>
<br>however, from some days the image of the forgery nucleus appears lengthened,
<br>show of strong activity.

Yes, the tail extending to the east ~PA 70 to 80 degress is showing much more fuller in recent images posted. I could just barely make it out in my first image of it from Dec 26.
<br>
<br>  8P seems to me more exciting than 17P.

<br>> Have you started imaging the M33 area?
<br>
<br>yes, before this area, then that of the 17P
<br>
<br>> Also  was wondering if you know what happened t the ASA yahoo board.  I have

Dear All,

<br>Details on the same picture.

<br>I managed to create an image median combining all the

<br>
<br>Also, the LS gradient shows very well the features I
<br>initially spotted on Dec. 28 (but visible on my 27 Dec.
<br>images too):
